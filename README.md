GENESIS 2.4 beta release development files
------------------------------------------

The 'genesis-2.4beta-files' project is a github repository of
files that are being developed for the November 2014 GENESIS 2.4
release. The final release (and possibly a public beta release)
will be available on the GENESIS 2 website (http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS)
and the Sourceforge GENESIS development site
http://sourceforge.net/projects/genesis-sim.

During the initial development of additions and changes to the GENESIS
neural simulator, the changed files will be distributed as replacement
files, rather than as patches, or a new GENESIS distribution.

The current files and directories that replace or add to one in the
GENESIS 'genesis' directory are in 'gen2.4-additions0.1'.
The complete collection may be downloaded by clicking on "Download ZIP".

See README-install.txt (or .html) for instructions for installing or
upgrading to the latest GENESIS 2.4 release.

These have been tested on recent Fedora and Ubuntu Linux installations.
I would appreciate reports of success or failure to compile on
other Linux versions, and for MacOS.
