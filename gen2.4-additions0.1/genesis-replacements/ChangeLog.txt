Each set of changes listed below is prefaced with the version number for
which the changes apply.  For development releases, two version numbers
are listed on separate lines, the first being the development release
version and the second being the proposed public release version.  The
proposed release is subject to discussion and change.


------------------------------------------
FINAL RELEASE 2.4
2014-October
------------------------------------------

- Three new network connection commands, 'volumeconnect3',
'volumeweight3', and 'volumedelay3', have been added and
documented. These allow distance-dependent connection
probabilities and/or weights and the use of periodic boundary
conditions for network connectivity.

- Added HTML indexing to the 'genesis' directory and subdirectories.
README files have been replaced or supplemented with '.txt' or '.html' files.

- Several source code bug-fixes and changes to src/Makefile.dist were
made in order to solve compilation problems on newer OS versions.

------------------------------------------
BETA RELEASE 2.4 beta
2014-July
------------------------------------------

- addition of 'stdp_rules' object, documentation, and Scripts for implementing
spike timing dependent plasticity in networks of hsolved cells

- the chemesis library for modeling second messengers and calcium dynamics
has been added to GENESIS

- new tutorial Scripts were added for chemesis, gpython-tools,
purkinje, stdp_rules, VAnet2

------------------------------------------
FINAL RELEASE 2.3
2006-March
------------------------------------------
-Last-minute pgenesis doc updates.

-Makefile.dist changes to development targets srcdist and bindist and some
comment clarifications.

-Added Izhikevich simple spiking neuron model objects and demo scripts. Plain
text documentation is included under Doc only.

-Added float_format field for asc_file and res_ascfile objects.

-Update of the new purkinje cell tutorial to allow graphing of multiple data
streams.

-Documentation has been revised for BoG.txt, Changes.txt, asc_file.txt, and 
Objects.txt, tabchannel.txt, README.cygwin.

-Some files were moved and Makefile.dist updated to facilitate creating src and
binary distributions with minimal impact on the existing directory hierarchy.


------------------------------------------
STABLE RELEASE CANDIDATE 2.3
2006-January
------------------------------------------
- Completely updated documentation! Including pgenesis and many of the
  tutorials.

- Fixed some display issues in the squid tutorial and eliminated the restriction
  on the number of steps which can be performed.

- Fixed crash of Xodus when resizing windows.

- Made Xodus dialogs behave correctly in the face of newer window managers
  which may attempt to enforce "focus stealing prevention".

- Script parser should now operate correctly on scripts with Mac- and Windows/
  DOS- like line endings.

- A new purkinje tutorial with a cell plugin framework, on-the-fly generation
  of tabchannels, and the ability to select compartment names for ascii ouput
  and current injection.

- Added channels and made some small changes to accomodate leechlib.

- Fixed small bug in Xodus display.

- Increased sizes of buffers for compartment names to accomodate cvapp
  conversion from neurolucida files.

- Updated kinetikit example files to sync with kkit11.

- Additional makefile targets for binary distributions.
  Intended for developers.


------------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT RELEASE 2.3 (aka 2.3 beta)
All changes intended for 2.3 release
2005-August
------------------------------------------

- Incorporated patches for variable argument functions.
  The old-style varargs.h usage is deprecated and has been replaced by
  stdarg.h.

- Incorporated MacOSX patches submitted by Alfonso Delgado-Reyes,
  Cengiz Gunay, and Werner Van Geit. Since OSX (and other OS's) may use
  case-insensitive file systems, some directory name conflicts
  were resolved under the Xodus tree.

- Incorporated Cygwin patches submitted by Sergio Daicz.
  Cygwin installations had the same problems mentioned above with Xodus
  directory names requiring the same solution. Other fixes included
  changing the size of hash table to avoid overflow. This was fixed by
  changing the hash table size to a prime number (10007), resulting in a
  more evenly distributed hash.

- Incorporated bug fixes for the kinetics library.

- Removed references to PARSER in Makefiles since it is no longer used.
  Since it's use was not well documented, it was tempting to define it
  with the same path as YACC. This would cause problems on most compilers
  since PARSER was used as an argument to '-D'.

- Removed [references to] extra fortran and C++ source code files.
  The fortran and c++ code libraries are not used by GENESIS.

- Modified Makefiles to pass appropriate variables to SPRNG.
  The SPRNG random number generation libraries should now compile on
  all known architectures. Variables are now passed from the top-level
  Makefile.


------------------------------------------
STABLE RELEASE 2.2.1
2005-June
------------------------------------------

* 2.2.1 development code relocated to sourceforge repository

- Changed AUTHORS permissions to 644 from 755

- Removed empty file VERSION_2.2.1

- Removed empty directory src/sprng/DOCS

- Added COPYRIGHT

- Added GLPLicense, GNU Lesser Public License

- Removed file src/diskio/interface/netcdf/netcdf-3.4/src/macros.make
  since it is generated from macros.make.in

- Removed Doc/Manual.tar.Z. Now accessible from the sourceforge
  project site. Updated Doc/README.manual to indicate relocation.

- Moved src/CHANGES to this file (ChangeLog).


------------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT RELEASE 2.2.1 (aka 2.2.1 beta)
All changes intended for 2.2.1 release
------------------------------------------

* Bug fixes from January 2002:

 - Changes to disk_out, asc_file, and res_ascfile.  In GENESIS 2.2, these
   three objects were changed to write data files in double precision
   format (type double) instead of single (type float).  Unfortunately, the
   resulting files were incompatible with the disk_in and xsimplot objects
   (which expect floats), and existing utilities that people have written
   to read the output of disk_out.  GENESIS 2.2.1 reverts to the single
   precision format.

 - Corrected a bug in the timetable object that can produce segmentation
   faults.

 - Corrected a bug in readcell (tools/new_parser.c).  When readcell was
   invoked twice, in order to create two different cells, Em in all the
   compartments of the second cell was set to 0, instead of the value of
   EREST_ACT that is specified in the cell parameter file.  (This doesn't
   happen if ELEAK is specifically set in the cell parameter file.)

 - Added changes from Mike Vanier to allow the the supplementary plotting
   program src/contrib/xplot (not the GENESIS xplot object) to compile with
   the Sun C compiler, as well a with gcc.

 - Although the use of "deleteall -force" is discouraged (it isn't always
   guaranteed to reset all parameters to the same values as when genesis
   was started), it is used in the Scripts/piriform simulation.  Mike
   Vanier fixed a bug in sim/sim_malloc.c that produced a segmentation
   violation when this command was used.  Some code cleanup was done in
   sim/sim_event.c, while investigating a possible bug.

 - Fixed some problems in executing the shell script "test_dir" in
   Scripts/piriform.

 - Fixed a corrupted data file "testfile" in
   Scripts/examples/diskiolib/diskio.

* Bug fixes from August 2002 genesis-2.2.1-beta-20020812

 - Fix to hines/hines_chip_init.c submitted by Hugo Cornelis.
   Instantaneous tabchannel gates (i.e. those that use the instant field)
   produced inaccurate results under hsolve chanmodes 2-5.

 - Fix to readcell (tools/new_parser.c) by Hugo Cornelis for core dump with
   difshell STOREINFLUX message.

 - Fixes submitted by Mikael Lindqvist for concen/fura2.c (missing break in
   PROCESS case, and incorrect MSGVALUE arguments for CONCEN message), and
   for concen/concpool.c (typo in test for dia <= 0.0).

 - Fix to sim/sim_dump.c, provided by Upi Bhalla.  It fixes a segmentation
   violation that happens with IRIX when kinetikit is used, but not under
   Linux.

-  Fix by Dave Beeman for an error in olf/olflib.g that caused the SUM
   message for the table2D object to fail.

 - Two new debugging commands gctrace (for tracing GENESIS commands) and
   gftrace (for tracing script language functions) were contributed by Hugo
   Cornelis.  The changed files are ss/script.y, ss/parse.h, ss/parse.c,
   ss/eval.c, ss/ss_func_ext.h, shell/shelllib.g, shell/shell_func_ext.h,
   shell/shell_exec.c, and shell/shell_debug.c.  Usage summary:
  
   gctrace <level>
   if <level> is 1, command tracing is enabled.
   if <level> is 0, command tracing disabled.

   gftrace <level>
   if <level> is 1, function tracing is enabled.
   if <level> is 0, function tracing disabled.

   gftrace is particularly useful for finding out which script functions are
   called from the script field of Xodus widgets without having to locate the
   widget in the genesis hierarchy.

* Bug fixes from March 2003:

 - Fixes from Mike Vanier for ss/script.y and convert/script.y to prevent
   parse errors with recent versions of GNU bison (e.g. ver. 1.75).

 - Fixes from Mike Vanier for ss/parse.h and convert/parse.h.
 
   According to Mike:  There was a type error involving the YYSTYPE
   expression and some ifdef's which had the combined effect of making the
   compiler think that YYSTYPE was an int even though it is defined here.
   I think that giving an explicit type for YYSTYPE is the Wrong Thing to
   do; you should always #define it since bison generates lines like
   "#ifdef YYSTYPE".  My fix was simple:  I just added '#define YYSTYPE
   YYSTYPE' after the typedef for YYSTYPE.

   Yes, this actually works.  Apparently, #define uses a separate namespace
   or something than the C compiler itself, so the "typedef union"
   statement above doesn't actually define YYSTYPE from the point of view
   of the preprocessor.  This is ugly, and I'm sure there is a better way
   to do things, but it works.

 - Changes provided by Malcom Tobias to allow IRIX 32 or 64 bit compilation
   flags to be passed down from the main genesis/src/Makefile.  Affects
   Makefile.dist, sprng/SRC/Makefile, sprng/SRC/lcg64/Makefile, and
   sprng/SRC/make.irix.

* Bug fixes from April and May 2003:

 - Fix to hines/hines_init.c submitted by Hugo Cornelis.  Fixes a bug
   triggered under OS's that do not use gnu malloc, i.e. Mac OSX and
   probably others, causing hsolve to give a 'bad access' violation.

 - New version of kinetics library and Scripts/kinetikit (ver. 9) from
   Upi Bhalla.  This fixes a problem creating pool objects with gcc 3.2.
   Scripts/kinetics/PARMS.g has been modified to set form sizes appropriate
   for a 1024 x 768 display.  Edit this file if you want larger forms for a
   higher resolution display.

 - Changes to Makefile.dist for IRIX 6.5 64-bit compile.

 - Replaced C++ style "//-" comments with "/* ... */" for K&R compatiblility
   in shell/shell_debug.c, shell_exec.c and ss/eval.c, parse.c.

 - Included <errno.h> in convert/strsave.c and symtab.c, needed for gcc 3.2.

 - Makefile.dist was modified so that the COPT define for the nxdefault target
   contains "-DNO_X".  This is needed by the file kinetics/text.c, which
   normally has some dependence on the XODUS xtext widget.

 - kinetics/file_info.c has been modified to disable the relatively obscure
   commands dirlist and maxfileversion when compiling under Solaris.  This is
   because they make use of the functions scandir() and alphasort() that are
   normally declared in /usr/include/dirent.h, except under Solaris.

----------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT RELEASE 2.2.3 (aka 2.2 beta)
All changes intended for 2.2 release
----------------------------------------

* Addition of Michael Vanier's parameter search library and elimination
  of Upi Bhalla's obsolete parameter search commands.

* Incorporation of numerous bug fixes and additions from Erik De
  Schutter and Hugo Cornelis from their "Antwerp" version of GENESIS,
  which is in turn based on GENESIS 2.1.  The main changes are:

  - Full support of symmetric compartments (also in hsolve).
  - The comptmode field is not used anymore (but it's still there for
    compatibility).
  - Corrected some spine utilities in readcell.  All the compartments in
    a spine are now indexed; this was necessary because findsolvefield
    could otherwise not find the synapse.
  - Instantaneous gating of tab(2D)channels possible with the use of the
    instant field.  Erik also included updated scripts for the traub91
    tutorial which demonstrate the use of the instant field (three shell
    variables are pre-defined) and uses symmetric compts in hsolve mode.
    These have been incorporated into the Scripts/traub91 scripts.
  - Supports single diffusion shells in a compartment.
  - New dev object: calculator (allows you to add, subtract etc using
    messages, no tables needed).
  - New concen object: hillpump (like mmpump but you can specify a
    Hill coefficient).
  - Added a TUBE shape for concpools and updated readcell.
  - TABSAVE and TABREAD now write/read platform independent binary files.
  - hsolve chanmode 5: like chanmode 4 but normalizes the currents and
    conductances stored in hsolve->givals array (for display purposes
    only).
  - Updates to readcell in tools/new_parser.c.

* The automatic attempt to interpret unknown GENESIS commands as UNIX
  shell commands inside {} is disabled by default unless the command is
  the first on the command line.  Executing shell commands elsewhere
  requires using "sh"; e.g., "echo {pwd}" does not work but "echo {sh
  pwd}" does.  This removes a potentially dangerous effect if the user
  mistypes a command such as "echo {rm * Ca}" instead of "echo {Rm *
  Ca}".

* Incorporation of Steve Van Hooser's 1998 changes to tools/new_parser.c
  to implement "double endpoint" mode in .p files and to extend
  "*lambda_warn" support to allow MIN and MAX parameters.

* Full support for SPRNG 1.0, a library of fast random number
  generators.  The SPRNG library is designed to select from among the
  provided RNGs at compile time.  src/Makefile defaults to using the
  Lagged Fibonacci Generator, which in testing proved to be fastest
  while also having the longest random number sequence.  The SPRNG
  random number generator can be selected at run-time (using the new
  command setrand) instead of the previous Numerical Recipes-based
  random number generation function.

* Setrandfield has been moved into tools and its -exponential option now
  works like planardelay's.

* Implementation of the facsynchan object by Michael Vanier.

* Complete reimplementation of xgif and ximage for displaying GIF
  images.  The new version does not suffer from problems on displays
  having more than 8-bit depths.  This fixes a problem with displaying
  under Solaris 2.6 CDE, reported by Avrama Blackwell and others.  The
  symptom was that calls to xgif would generate "X Error of failed
  request: BadValue".

* Incorporation of newest version of netCDF library (v. 3.4).  (Changes
  provided by Upi Bhalla.)

* Diskio support for FMT1 files by Venkat Jagadish.  NOTE: the
  associated changes in XODUS result in diskio being a required
  component for a full genesis.  NetCDF can still be excluded if
  desired.

* Reimplementation of GENESIS 1 xsimplot by Venkat Jagadish.

* New XODUS object xfastplot plus various XODUS fixes from Upi Bhalla:

  - Minor typecasting stuff in Xodus/widg to get a cleaner compile.
  - Addition of the FastPlot widget, which is essentially an
    oscilloscope widget: fast and economical.
  - An XgEventStep routine in Initialize.c, which does a single
    event rather than exhaust the pending X events. It can be safely
    ignored, as it turned out to be too unweildy.
  - Minor fix to xshape to correct buffer overruns.
  - Commented out an irritating printf in the xtree. Lets Kinetikit
    start out without warnings.
  - Added callback to ximage to try to get it to respond to mouse
    clicks. Not yet complete.
  - Fix in xo_callb.c which protects against segvs in some situations.
    Some stuff in hines, which may just be fixes applied on the CDROM
    after I got my version.  I don't remember doing much there.
  - A significant fix in hines_child.c which replaces some huge
    dynamic arrays with static ones.  This enables it to run on alpha
    Linux.
  - Some awful hacks in the kinetics library, which make things go
    about 2 to 4x as fast specially on newer CPUs by bypassing the usual
    messaging.  Should be completely transparent to the user, and I have
    not had trouble with them for over a year.  But you can decide.
  - Added object substitution in sum_dump.c

* Fixes to xfastplot implementation to solve X Windows errors on systems
  using non-Pseudocolor visuals by default.

* Incorporation of Dieter Jaeger's spike analysis library.  David
  Bilitch did the work; he noted the following: "I've integrated the
  spike analysis library with devices.  I've taken Dave Beeman's
  suggestion and renamed doac and doxc to autocorr and crosscorr.  I
  also fetched Dieter's versions of freq_monitor and peristim and made
  these the default.  The old versions continue to be compiled in,
  though they are not added as objects.  There are a couple of variables
  in the devlib.g startup which can toggle between the old and new
  versions (requiring a recompile).  I've also changed the class for
  autocorr and crosscorr to device as Dieter suggested."

* Enhancements to src/device/timetable.c from Dieter Jaeger.

* New function "fileconnect" from Upi Bhalla, plus associated demo
  scripts in Scripts/examples/fileconnect.

* Changes to the normalization of ACTIVATION messages to a synchan, to
  make them behave the same with hsolve as without.  Implementation and
  mods to the Purkinje tutorial by Hugo Cornelis; fixes to the spinedemo
  by Dave Beeman.

* Addition of new function, "countelementlist", by Hugo Cornelis.  Using
  a wildcard that expands a list like {argc} to more than 1000 elements
  produced a core dump.  The new function allows scripts to count
  elements in a list and thereby be used to let scripts behave more
  smartly with large lists.

* New actions OUT_OPEN and OUT_WRITE added to asc_file from Michael
  Vanier.

* Hitting ^V now prints the current version string.

* Readcell now gives a different value for the axial resistance of a
  spherical compartment in GENESIS 2.2 than it did in 2.1.  Ra is chosen
  as being that of an equivalent cylinder C with the same surface and
  volume as the sphere S, where lenC = 3/2 diaS and diaC = 2/3 diaS.
  Changes by Erik De Schutter.

* Large number of portability fixes to Makefiles and code for the
  following: Solaris 2.6 and 2.7, Red Hat Linux 5.2 and 6.x, Debian
  Linux, Mandrake Linux 7.0, SGI IRIX 6.5.3, 6.5.8 and 6.5.10, FreeBSD
  4.1, and IBM AIX 4.2 and 4.3.

* The default compilation flags when using gcc now include -O2 and sets
  __NO_MATH_INLINES.

* Fixes for outlib from Greg Hood.

* Fixes to src/ss/eval.c from Michael Vanier to improve the traceback
  messages.

* Fixes from Greg Hood, Elliot Menschik and Chris Butson for compiling
  GENESIS on the SGI Origin.

* Fixes to hsolve from Greg Hood for compiling with optimization under
  Red Hat Linux and the Cray T3E.

* Fixes from Greg Hood for PGENESIS, including portability fixes for Red
  Hat Linux and fixes to rvolumedelay and rvolumeweight.

* Fixes to src/ss/script.l to fix compilation under Solaris using Sun's
  yacc.

* Fixes for tab2Dchannel bug discovered by Dave Beeman in Nov 1999 in
  the pre-release DR 2.2.2.  The bug symptom is that Upi Bhalla's mitral
  cell simulation produced NaN values for the tab2Dchannel X gate.

* Fixes for src/oldconn/personal/expsum.c by Michael Vanier.
* Fixes to remarg from Michael Vanier.

* Fixes to randomize_value in newconn/delay.c from Michael Vanier.

* Fix src/startup/schedule.g to add an init action to PID.

* Fixes to newconn library delay2.c and weight2.c from David Beeman.

* Fixes from Hugo Cornelis to src/out/spike_history.c.

* Fixes from Hugo Cornelis to src/shell/shell_hash.c

* Fix to the version command: it now returns a string value to avoid
  displaying a version number like 2.09999...

* Fix to pastechannel: it was using the full pathname of the source
  channel when attempting to name the pasted channel in addmsg/sendmsg
  message setup.  Now uses just the pasted channel name.

* Fixes to synchan, hebbsynchan and facsynchan from Michael Vanier.

* Fix to pathname(), which now allows many more concurrent pathname
  strings to be in use.  The exact number is dependent on the pathname
  lengths.  Currently allows up to 1000 chars concurrently.  This limit
  is controlled by the PATHNAMES_BUF_LEN define, which may be overridden
  by adding an appropriate define in the Makefile or suitable header
  file.

* Fix from Dave Beeman for a numerical error in the calculation of beta
  in TabToFile (src/olf/new_interp.c).

* Fix from Erik De Schutter to calculation of diffusion, involving
  contact between shells.  This affected a few files in src/concen,
  hines/hines_conc_init.c, and files in Scripts/examples/spinedemo/.

* Fix by Dave Beeman to calculation error in tab2file in olf/new_interp.c.

* Fixes to script_out by Hugo Cornelis.

* Fix to hsolve by Hugo Cornelis that permits an hsolve DUPLICATE to be
  performed from any working element if you use an absolute pathname as
  the first call argument.  The new syntax is
    call hsolve1 DUPLICATE hsolve2 duplic_path

* Fixes to hsolve from Hugo Cornelis for a bug in which Vm is loaded too
  late under some circumstances.

* Fix to provide tabcurrent elements created by readcell with the needed
  VOLTAGE and CHANNEL messages.

* Fix by Hugo Cornelis for a bug in hines/hines_chip.c that caused hsolved
  synchans to have inaccuracies in the calculated Gk for large time
  steps.

* Fix by Hugo Cornelis for a bug in newconn/synchan.c that caused the Gk
  calculated by synchans to lag behind the current simulation time by one
  time step.

  NOTE: These fixes have not been applied to the obsolete channelC2 and
  channelC3 objects.  Also, it should be noted that output objects (xplot,
  asc_file, disk_out, etc.)  report the time from the previous step.  This
  behavior has not been changed in GENESIS 2.2, because it may affect
  simulations that do comparisons between values produced by asc_file,
  disk_out, etc. with some existing files.

* Addition to tools/new_parser.c by Jose Manuel Ibarz del Olmo to prevent a
  negative shell volume, in case someone should assign a value of thick >
  dia/2 to a Ca_concen when using readcell.

* Fix to initialization in param/gen2spk.c by Lazarewicz Maciej.

* Fixes for AIX from Claus Weiland and Alex Kozlov.

* Fix to hines/hines_conc.c from Erik De Schutter for a bug that caused
  numerical errors in simulations without buffers.

* Eliminination of old parallel library and -parallel option in
  src/tools/cell_sheet.c.

* Numerous modification to top-level Makefile.dist & Makefile.<machine>,
  including:

  - Plain old "make" now does what "make all" previously did
  - Eliminate warnings about "@echo: command not found"
  - Fix "make install" to do a better job of installing into a
    destination directory that is not the root of the GENESIS tree.

* Fix to startup/Usermake from Christo Panchev for compiling
  nongraphical version of GENESIS.

* Introduction of src/contrib, which currently contains just one item,
  Michael Vanier's version of xplot.

* Removal of src/olf/hh_tabchan.c and corresponding changes in olflib.g
  and related Makefiles.

* Renaming of src/newconn/hebbsynchan3.c to newconn/hebbsynchan.c.

* Renaming of src/newconn/newconn.g to src/newconn/newconnlib.g.

* Renaming of src/newconn/synchan2.c to src/newconn/synchan.c.

* Removal of no longer used files src/newconn/synutils_test.g and
  src/newconn/synutils2_test.g.

* Significant cleaning up of code throughout GENESIS to reduce or
  eliminate various inconsistencies involving datatypes.

* Significant cleaning up of all code to reduce the number of
  compilation warnings.

* Improvement of comments in src/Makefile and src/startup/Usermake about
  the procedures for building GENESIS.

* Usermake file now allows for building nxgenesis, not just regular
  graphical genesis.

* Enhancements to comments in src/Makefile.dist and src/README dealing
  with some common problems involving alternate paths for some files or
  libraries.

* Verification of Y2K compliance to satisfy Springer-Verlag.

        - Incorrectly called functions
        - Uninitilized variables
        - unallocated memory accesses

    - hines/hh_update.c contains an inline function which sometimes fails
      to compile properly.  Added an INLINE macro which if set to nothing
      (the default) will inhibit this inlining.  Add -DINLINE=inline to
      CFLAGS to enable the inlining.

    - Bug preventing hsolve from calling the HPROCESS action is fixed.
    
    - planarweight2 and planardelay2 added.  These versions require
      specification of both the source and destination elements and
      improve the speed of setting the weights and delays.

    - Bug in synchans which would sometimes prevent delivery of spikes
      is fixed.
      
    - Changed many comparisons in new_interp.c for setupalpha, et al for
      == 0.0 to fabs(...) < SING_TINY.  SING_TINY is 1e-6.      

    - A command callback mechanism was implemented to support calling
      functions at exit.  This was used to ensure diskio files are closed
      at normal exit.
      
    - Added icons in xstartup.g for new channel objects.

      Alphas has been fixed. (2.0.1)

    - A bug in the XtVaSetValues() function causing problems on
      DEC Alphas (and probably on other 64bit machines) has been
      worked around by providing a fixed version of the Xt code
      involved.  The Xt problem appears to exist in all X11 versions
      through X11R6. (2.0.1)

    - A number of additional DEC Alpha related fixes in the
      Xodus/Draw library. (2.0.1)

    - XoGetPixelFromString() now handles pixes correctly. (2.0.1)

      within a form using a nested form. (2.1)

    - Added special handling of first message in loading messages
      from a dump. (2.0.1)

    - Dump files now use the new -continue option to loadtab to
      allow continuation of loading long lists of table values. (2.1)

    - The element path wildcard routines will now process white
      space separated lists of path specifications and include all
      elements matching each path.  (Note that the commands still
      take a single wildcard path argument and that the path list
      must be passed in this single argument.) (2.1)

    - A bug in special handling of the stdlib.h file for GNU gcc when
      optimization is on caused the stdlib.h header to be skipped if
      optimization was off.  This header is included in all cases now.
      (2.0.1)

    - The loadtab command for loading tables from dump files has a
      -continue option to work around script language limitations on
      command line length. (2.1)

      more restrictive. (2.1)

    - References to hebbsynchan2 have been removed (2.0.1)

    - Fixes for synchan/hebbsynchan MOD message and frequency normalization
      bugs. (2.0.1)

RELEASE 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This file contains information about changes introduced in updates
    to GENESIS 2.0.  For information on changes from GENESIS 1.4 to
    GENESIS 2.0, please see the GENESIS Reference Manual.

------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 19
------------------

    - Additional comments about SGIs in src/Makefile.dist

    - Various changes in src/README regarding supported systems
      and SGI issues.

    - A bug in xview and xvar widgets affecting morphing of
      shapes when the value range low and high values are
      equal has been fixed.

    - Xview update problems resulting in an incorrect initial
      display are fixed.  The problem likely affected display
      during the simulation as well.

    - The xtree ADDMSGARROW problem in calling the script_add
      and script_drop scripts with incorrect arguments has been
      fixed.

    - The Usermake reference to the doc file describing how to
      compile user libraries changed to refer to the new file name.

    - Xdefaults.example has been changed to use the same resource
      values found in the fallback resources within Xodus.

------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 18
------------------

    - Copies of xshape objects no longer share the string field
      values of the copied element.  Additional code to close
      memory leaks in xshape resulted in freeing the fields from
      the copied element.

    - xcell was writing past the end of two allocated arrays.
      Now allocates the correct array sizes.

    - xdialog and xlabel now have COPY actions which copy string
      field values.  Other widgets do not yet implement COPY actions,
      but need to, since the internal Xt widget ends up being shared
      between copies, but is destroyed if any one widget is deleted.

    - NULL widget fields no longer set the corresponding Xt widget
      resource to "nil".

------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 17
------------------

    - The -coords option for x1shape objects ended up setting the
      npts field to the number of coords in the first argument
      following the -coords option name.  This no longer happens.

    - xview has been fixed so as not to change colors when the input
      data is not changing.

    - The hebsynchan object has been returned to the HebbSynchan
      implementation, however, hebbsynchan2 is still removed.

------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 16
------------------

    - xcell was not calculating the width of the soma resulting in
      the soma not appearing on the display.  xcell now calculates
      the correct screen width.

    - Additional xtree selection fixes from Upi Bhalla

    - Code has been added to xvar and xview to avoid division
      by zero if the low and high limit on input values are the
      same.  In these cases, the color defined by the low limit
      shape is used.

    - xpixflags is now the official name for the pixflags conversion
      command.  The old pixflags command name is retained for BC.

    - The xpixflags command now uses the getopt() routines and its
      usage message documents the negation operator as a tilde(~).

    - A bug in xpixflags returning static storage after printing a
      usage statement has been fixed to allocate the return value.

    - Core leaks in setting of string fields in various widgets have
      been patched.

    - Added a -nox option to the genesis command line which results
      in Xodus not being initialized.  A related command, xgetstat,
      has been added which returns 0 if Xodus is not properly init-
      ialized.

    - The xon command has been removed.  The xinit command now maps
      to a message indcating that xinit is no longer needed.  (We
      wouldn't want scripts accidently calling the X11 xinit command!)

    - A problem with X1compat handling multiple arguments to the x1shape
      -coords create command option has been fixed.

    - convert now removes the xinit command when converting scripts.

    - Changes from Erik DeSchutter to handle INJECT messages in hsolve
      chanmode 0/1.

    - The hebbsynchan object is now using the HebbSynchan2 implementation
      and there is no longer a hebbsynchan2 object.

    - Deleting an element while it is the cwe will now immediately ce
      to the root element.

    - The Xdefaults.example file with values suitable for SGI systems
      has been added.  It installs in the startup directory.

    - Libmake has been modified to describe that use of the FUNCTIONS
      file is no longer necessary, but also provides instructions for
      setting up the Makefile to use an old FUNCTIONS file is desired.

    - Usermake has been updated to include the oldconn library by
      default.

    - A bug in code_g resulting the hashfunc command setting the return
      type of the function to void even when another return type is
      given is fixed.

    - readcell will now use full compartment volumes for Ca_concen if
      the thick field is less or equal to zero or greater than the
      compartment diameter.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 15
Sat Jul 29 11:54:30 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - A bug in gcc 2.6.3 stdlib.h causes a number of function type
      definitions to be redeclared with incompatible types.  A work
      around had been implemented in the affected files.

    - Clean up of memory allocation of string resources.

    - Colorscale colors are no longer freed when using a readonly
      visual.

    - Xshapes should correctly set fg colors.

    - Various memory leak fixes.

    - The execute command has been removed.

    - The affweight and affdelay commands have been added to the oldconn
      library.  These command should be used in lieu of "execute AffWeight"
      and "execute AffDelay".

    - The compartment and symcompartment object now initialize default
      values for Rm and Cm to 1 to avoid divide by zero FPE errors for
      uninitialized compartments.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 14
Fri Jul 21 14:58:42 PDT 1995
----------------------------

	- Minor changes for compiling under HPUX.  There are still
	  problems with XODUS on this platform.

	- The CPG tutorial sersion using xvar objects should now
	  display properly.

	- Additional changes for xtree drag and drop operations have
	  been made.

	- The -coords option used in creating xshapes will now accept
	  the coordinate list as multiple arguments.  Long coordinate
	  lists should be broken into multiple arguments to avoid
	  command argument length limitations.  The xstartup.g script
	  has been updated accordingly and convert no longer combines
	  multiple coordinate arguments into a single argument.

	- The Ca_shell object has been merged into Ca_concen and the
	  dia field from Ca_shell is called thick in Ca_concens.

	- A bug in volumeconnect's handling of mask coordinate values has
	  been fixed.

	- The floatformat command no longer accepts %d as a valid format,
	  which leaves %g and %f as the only valid formats.

	- The echo command now verifies that the -format option value is
	  a single %s conversion.  Other conversions or multiple conversions
	  will be rejected.

	- Lookup of C function addresses for functions not identified in
	  a library startup script no longer fail under Linux.

	- A arguments for a script named on the genesis command line are
	  correctly passed to the executing script.

	- Interupting execution of the .simrc or command line script will
	  now place the user at the SLI prompt instead of exiting GENESIS.

	- GENESIS no longer dumps core when given an incorrect syntax for
	  indexing an array field of an element in setfield, etc.

	- Memory leaks which occured on reset have been patched.

	- Unknown channels which appear in a cell file now produce an
	  appropriate error message from readcell.

	- Pressing buttons while another script is in progress no longer
	  results in unexpected script behaviour (e.g. widgets no longer 
	  appear in the wrong form, elements which are expected to exist
	  will, etc.).

	- Linux make should no longer perform endless recursions in the
	  oldconn directory.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 13
Sat Jul  8 13:33:28 PDT 1995
----------------------------

	- X11R3 support in src/Makefile.dist has been removed as Xodus 2
	  will not compile under anything less than X11R4.

	- xcell fixes: single compartment cells now work correctly, auto
	  calculation of diamax and diamin works for all autodia settings,
	  settings for path/field/fieldpath fields no longer require a reset
	  to take effect (inconsistent settings of these fields will be
	  ignored).

	- Multiple redraws of pixes resulting from setting pix fields have
	  been reduced.

	- The colorscale will now default to half black and half white rather
	  than requiring that a table be loaded.

	- xview now supports autoscaling as in Xodus 1

	- xview core dump which would sometimes happen at reset have been
	  fixed.

	- drag/drop of xtree pixes no longer cause a core dump.

	- X1compat will correctly initialize diarange and autodia fields
	  of x1cells to values consistent with Xodus 1.

	- The showalias command is now called showcommand.

	- Indirect fields now call the correct SET actions.

	- Callbacks to script commands which return a NULL string will
	  no longer interrupt script execution with the message "CastToInt:
	  NULL string".

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 12
Fri Jun 23 18:02:44 PDT 1995
----------------------------

	- The problems associated with Netkit.g and other xtree related scripts
	  on SunOS and SGI-IRIX 5.2 should be fixed.

	- Warning note to set the path field of xtree, xcell and xview elements
	  as absolute path names will appear only if the path field has been 
	  set relatively.

	- Spurious error messages which occur when setting the path, field
	  and fieldpath fields of xcell have been fixed.  Changes to these
	  fields will not take effect until the next call to reset (or to
	  an explicit call to the RESET action on the xcell).

	- xcell will now accept character equivalents to its numeric
	  settings for autodia as originally intended (e.g. 0 = f, 1 = s,
	  2 = t, 3 = c).

	- ReadCell now allows the user to build a cell under a neutral if it
	  already exists and has no children.

	- A problem in Makefile.dist which caused problems with FreeBSD's
	  version of make has been fixed.

	- The cell_sheet command no longer makes a direct call to
	  CopyConnections() in the connection compatibility library.
	  It should now be possible to compile GENESIS without the
	  connection compatibility library (the default in Usermake).

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 11
Fri Jun 16 15:52:40 PDT 1995
----------------------------

	- A number of enhancements have been made to provide FreeBSD 
	  compatibility to genesis. Thanks are due to Rich Murphy for all 
	  his FreeBSD specific enhancements, which have been folded in to 
	  the distribution.

	- The xcell, xvar and the xview Xodus elements have a new color 
	  calculation scheme that avoids arithmetic overflows. 

	- Changes to the xtree widget to cleanly interpret and perform tasks 
	  based on user-clicks have been implemented.

	- Additional clean-ups and fixes for resource converters in Xodus. This
	  should address some problems related to complaints on inability to
	  allocate certain specified colors.

	- A new warning message explains to the user that the path field for
	  xview, xtree and xcell Xodus elements should contain an absolute pathname,
	  if it does not find the elements specified in its path.

	- xcell now correctly displays 2-compartmental cells.

	- The Hodgkin-Huxley channels have code that defensively avoids 
	  exponentiation of huge numbers and consequent overflows.

	- Genesis will no longer exit when any command is piped through an
	  external command (e.g more) and it is interrupted.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 10
Mon Jun 12 16:32:24 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - Fixes to additional problems with Xodus resource converters.
      This will hopefully address a problem on DEC Alpha's where
      the xcmds.g TestSuite script complains that it can't convert
      certain xaxis resources and later dumps core.

    - The xtext widget which is used for displaying help information
      in various tutorials will now correctly display text containing
      tab characters.

    - A new GENESIS command line option -defaultcolor will cause
      GENESIS to use the display's default colormap, even if the
      default visual is readonly.  The net result is that colorscale
      colors will be shared among multiple GENESIS processes, but
      GENESIS will fail to allocate a colorscale if the default
      colortable is full.

    - A problem in specifying resource values for the background and
      border pixels for windows has been fixed.  This may fix the
      problems in running GENESIS on SGI which default to a TrueColor
      visual.  The -defaultcolor option might also be usedful in
      working around the SGI TrueColor problem.

    - Toggling overlays on and off in the Neuron tutorial should no
      longer result in a core dump.  This problem which manifested
      itself under AIX on an IBM RS6000 machine is very general and
      could have happened in any case where elements are deleted and
      reset or resched is not run before stepping the simulation.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 9
Fri Jun  2 17:24:00 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - Deficiencies in Xodus' resource converter code have been fixed.
      This may fix reported problems with the CPG tutorial where on
      SGI's and some Linux systems the cells were drawn as arrows
      rather than filled and on other Linux systems where some or
      all of the shapes representing connections did not appear.

    - Bug fixes to the hsolve object.  An implicit RESET of nernst
      elements was causing a divide by zero error on DEC Alphas.
      Error checking code has also been added for the [XYZ]power
      values of tabchannels (within hsolve).

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 8
Tue May 30 18:18:02 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - Bug fix for Makefile.alpha which resulted in a sh syntax error.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 7
Fri May 26 10:29:09 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - Additional problems in updating xdialog text when uncovered
      by an obsuring widget have been fixed.

    - The convert progrem now generates correct code in converting
      the "set -env" command.

    - An error in the patch 6 changes to disk_in to support the
      1.4 xfileview functionality has been fixed.   This error
      caused compiler errors under Linux (and probably anywhere
      else using gcc) and would probably corrupt the heap on
      other systems.

    - The @node syntax for remote commands in parallel GENESIS
      now allows commas to appear in the node specification.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 6
Wed May 17 13:22:34 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - A bug introduced in patch 5 affecting handling of Xodus geometry
      values has been fixed.

    - Makefile.dist now passes the RANLIB macro properly when "make
      install" is run.

    - The xview and disk_in objects have been modified so that together
      they can support functionality equivalent to the GENESIS 1.4
      xfileview widget.

    - The xplot object now has an ADDPTS action which provides the same
      functionality as the GENESIS 1.4 xaddpts command.

    - The hsolve object now issues an appropriate error message when
      the path field does not match any elements.

    - Indexing outside the bounds of the string in a substring command
      is detected and reported as an error.

    - A bug in checking the indexing of pointer element fields resulting
      in the message "invalid array indexing" for valid uses of indexing
      a pointer value has been fixed.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 5
Mon May  8 22:45:58 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - Changes to Makefile.Linux supporting the setting of the YACC,
      LEX and LEXLIB macros in the main Makefile which were omitted
      in the previous patch have been added in this one.

    - Xodus will no longer dump core when trying to create an xform
      after failing to initialize Xodus.

    - GENESIS no longer dumps core when the command "showobject xform"
      is given.

    - Additional modifications have been made to the handling of X11
      visuals at Xodus initialization.  Xodus should no longer
      produce an X protocol error on displays which default to a
      TrueColor visual.

    - The -holerange and -offset options to gen3dmsg now work as
      advertised.

    - The cmd@node syntax for parallel simulations will now accept
      the same syntax for the node as other command arguments.  This
      allows alot of freedom in specifying the node spec (e.g.

	echo@{nodespec}
	echo@{onenode},{anothernode}

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 4
Fri Apr 28 12:40:54 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    NOTICE
    
    The changes in this patch to Makefile.dist make it necessary for
    all users to copy Makefile.dist to Makefile and reconfigure the
    Makefile.

    - As of this patch, all change notices will appear in this file.

    - A bug in the handling of the command@node syntax for calling a
      script function remotely has been fixed.

    - A bug in the convert program which would have caused conversion
      of string concatentaion using + to use the new @ operator to
      fail has been fixed.  The bug could also have manifested itself
      in a core dump on some systems.

    - Two new command line options are now available.  The -execdir
      option takes the following argument as a directory path into
      which GENESIS will change before startup.  The -nice options
      takes the following argument as a nice value to run GENESIS
      at.  These options are used by the parallel library in starting
      remote GENESIS nodes.

    - The script language yacc and lex definition files have been
      updated to work properly with the GNU bison and flex programs
      which are used on Linux systems.  This should also allow systems
      without yacc or lex to obtain and use the GNU programs.

    - A problem in initializing plot colors from xgraph PLOT messages
      which resulted in black plots, color name conversion error messages
      and core dumps when using overlay mode has been fixed.

    - Various updates to suggested settings in Makefile.dist have been
      made affecting Solaris 2.4 w/gcc, DEC alpha, SGI and Linux systems.
      There are also new macro settings to allow use of other yacc and
      lex programs like GNU bison and flex.

    - Xodus/Makefile now properly passes the RANLIB macro value to the
      Xodus subdirectory Makefiles when "make install" is run.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 3
Thu Apr 13 14:05:59 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    - src/Makefile.dist suggested settings for MACHINE=alpha have been
      changed.

    - Adding -DGETOPT_PROBLEM to CFLAGS in src/Makefile will avoid
      problems with differences between the GENESIS getopt()
      implementation and the standard library version.  If GENESIS will
      not compile due to errors related to the getopt() function or the
      optopt variable add -DGETOPT_PROBLEM to CFLAGS.  This is known to
      be a problem on some alpha machines.

    - A problem where xgraphs using the X message for phase plots would
      not display anything unless resized or autoscaled has been fixed.
      This problem is likely to have caused the same symptoms when no X
      message is present.

    - Bugs in the getsyndest and getsynsrc commands which caused GENESIS
      to hang on Linux systems after finishing the command have been fixed.

    - The include of search.h in convert/mapcommand.c which prevented a
      successful compilation of the convert program on some Linux systems
      has been removed.

    - The convert program now handles conversion of set -env commands
      better.  Code is generated which adds the named field if it
      doesn't already exist.

    - The Scripts/X1compat directory is now added by default to the
      SIMPATH in the .simrc file.

    - Plot colors and labels will no longer revert to the values given
      in the PLOT message on a reset.  For example, if a plot color is
      changed by setting the fg field of the xplot, a reset doesn't 
      change it back to what the PLOT message color value.

    - The cell file *set_compt_param command allows a script variable to
      be used to set the compartment parameter.  The script variable may
      be named directly or placed in curly braces as in SLI scripts.

    - Functions supporting the old save and restore commands which
      reference the system dependent etext, edata, etc. values have
      been removed.  RS6000/AIX machines should compile now.

    - An extraneous argument to both the XFillRectangle() and
      XDrawSegments() functions in XoDraw.c have been removed.

    - In Xodus/Xo/XoPS.c calls to XQueryFont incorrectly passing a GC
      rather than a GID have been fixed.

    - Additional problems with forms requiring placement by the
      window manager have been fixed.

    - Preprocessed output from the yacc and lex programs will not be
      provided any longer.  Some systems have differing implementations
      for these programs and fail at the link stage when using the
      provided yacc and lex output.  The patch provides an update to
      the yacc and lex input files which will cause them to be
      reprocessed.

BETA 2.0, PATCH 2
Fri Apr  7 21:56:32 PDT 1995
----------------------------

    NOTICE

    Starting with this patch, the standard distribution version
    of src/Makefile will appear as src/Makefile.dist.  This is
    necessary as src/Makefile is customized by the user and a
    patch to this file is bound to fail at some point.

    Fixes

    - GENESIS 2.0 now compiles correctly on IBM rs6000 systems
      running AIX.  There is now a MACHINE=aix option in
      src/Makefile.dist and a src/Makefile.aix.  Check the CFLAGS
      options in src/Makefile.dist which are necessary for things
      to work.

    - The -lXaw in the XLIBS line in src/Makefile.dist has been
      removed.  This caused at least one system to issue errors
      for multiply defined symbols.  Xodus no longer uses any
      of the Athena widgets.

    - Graph axes now display single character titles correctly.

    - A problem with widgets borders which caused in some instances
      the borders not to display along the full length and height of
      the widget has been fixed.

    - The bg field of dialogs now set the entire background of the
      dialog rather than a small area near the dialog's borders.

    - A problem with the fvwm window manager which prevented any
      keyboard input to widgets has been fixed.

    - A bug which caused problems doing drag and drop operations on
      Tree widgets has been fixed.

    - Form widgets are now sized such that the width and height
      given in a geometry string defined the total size of the
      form including borders.  Previously, the width and height
      determined the size of the usable form space inside the
      borders.

    - The hsolve element now initializes is Vm values at reset from
      compartment initVm values rather than Em values.  It should
      no longer be necessary to use the Vm_reset flag to initialize
      an hsolve element.  NOTE: the Vm_reset field will be removed
      in the near future.

    - A problem where genesis and code_g were unable to find their
      executable files at startup when . was not on the path and a
      relative path was used has been fixed.

    - Replacement functions for the index(), rindex() and bcopy()
      functions in sys/system_deps.c compiled in for most SYSV
      systems where written using ANSI C syntax.  They've been
      replaced with K&R C code.

    - A problem with the scaling of difpool elements in readcell
      has been fixed.

    Other Changes

    - Several of the system specific src/Makefile.dist CFLAGS
      settings didn't include -O which has been added as a default.

    - Dialogs now allow use of the mouse to position the text cursor.

----------------------------
BETA 2.0, PATCH 1
----------------------------

    Fixes

    - Problems preventing compilation of sim_main.c on some SYSV
      systems due to a BSD specific library function call (setlinebuf)
      has been fixed.

    - A bug in sim_main.c in calling the simrc script at startup
      has been fixed.  The bug affects all systems, but only caused
      problems when using gcc under Solaris.

    - Explicit uses of cc in the sys/Makefile have been changed to
      use the CC macro defined in src/Makefile.  This fixes a problem
      on systems using a C compiler which is not named cc.

    - Version information has been updated to reflect the Beta
      release version.

    Other Changes

    - The convert.man page has been updated to describe the
      -noX1compat option to convert.  This is installed under
      man/man1 on a make install.

    Known Problems

    An asterix indicates that the problem should be fixed in the
    first set of patches.

    *   - Under Solaris sim/sim_main.c does not compile because the
	  setlinebuf() function isn't in the standard C library.

    *   - Systems using gcc or any other compiler not named cc will
	  fail in compiling the code generator commands in sys as the
	  makefile uses a hardcoded cc command.  This problem may be
	  worked around by linking gcc (for example) to cc.

	- Under Linux, the convert command may fail to compile as the
	  header file search.h used in mapcommand.c cannot be found.
	  This should not affect the compilation of GENESIS.

	- The GENESIS graphical interface does not run properly on a
	  StaticGrey visual.  The xdpyinfo command is useful in finding
	  out what types of visuals your X-Windows system supports.
