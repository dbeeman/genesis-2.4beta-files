<H2><A NAME="chemesis"><A NAME="s17.5">The 'chemesis' library of GENESIS objects</A></H2>

<P>
'chemesis' is a library of objects for creating models of biochemical
reactions, second messengers, and calcium dynamics.

<P>
This library is based on chemesis version 2.5, and was developed and contributed
to the GENESIS 2.4 libraries by K. T. (Avrama) Blackwell. The main website for
the latest chemesis source code, tutorials, simulation scripts, and lecture
slides is http://krasnow1.gmu.edu/CENlab/software.html.

<P>
Demonstration scripts and tutorials may be found in genesis/Scripts/chemesis.
The source code for these objects and their data structure is given in
genesis/src/chemesis.

<H2><A NAME="section-1.1.">chemesis provides the following objects:</A></H2>

<P>
 cicr: computes state variables associated with calcium release channels, either
 the ryanodine or ip3 receptor channel

<P>
 cicrflux: computes ion flow through ip3 or Ryr receptor channel from the smooth
 endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and the cytosol.

<P>
 conservepool: calculates concentration &amp; quantity in a compartment by
 subtracting the conc/quantity of all other forms of the molecule

<P>
 diffusion: calculates flux across the shared/connected surface areas

<P>
 enzyme: implements a reaction pool, and the two coupled reactions implementing
 and enzyme reaction

<P>
 feedback: calculates enhancement or reduction in an enzyme activity by another
 substrance

<P>
 mmenz: simplified michaelis-menton enzyme reaction

<P>
 mmpump2: Michaelis-Menten pump. unlike mmpump, this object calculates flux due
 to the pump

<P>
 ncx: implements two different forms of a sodium-calcium exchanger

<P>
 reaction: computes kf*substrates and kb*products for nth order reactions.

<P>
 rhodopsin: quite a complicated object for calculating stochastic activation and
 inactivation of rhodopsin molecules

<P>
 rxnpool: accumulates changes in quantity and concentration from many other
 chemesis objects and then calculates the new concentration This object is
 similar to pool (kinetikit) and functions similar to compartment, which
 accumulates current fluxes.

<P>
 wgtavg: An object to calculate a weighted average, such as mean calcium in a
 set of shells.

<P>
Note that chemesis does not require you to work in SI units, but if you don't,
you need to set various units fields on all the objects, and you must use a set
of consistent units.

<H2><A NAME="section-1.2.">Documentation for the objects is given below:</A></H2>

<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>

<P>
cicr computes state variables associated with calcium release channels, either
the ryanodine or ip3 receptor channel.  Create one element for each receptor
state, thus ip3 receptor of DeYoung and Keizer requires 8 cicr elements.  cicr
calculates the fraction of receptors in each state, the flux is calculated using
a cicrflux element.  Transitions between ASTATE are dependent on IP3
concentration (a required message for cicr) thus only BSTATE and GSTATE
elements, which transitions are calcium dependent, are created for ryanodine
receptor channel.

endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and the cytosol.  This requires at least two
rxnpools, one tracking calcium in the SER and one tracking calcium in the
cytosol.  All three messages are required.  the IP3R message is really just the

Diffusion is an object used to computes flux of molecules due to diffusion
through shared surface between two rxnpools. This object can implement both 1-D
and 2-D diffusion, and sums the fluxes between each pair of rxnpools. 2D
diffusion is implemented among a set of cylindrical shells, with the surface
area of the side of the cylinder stored in SAside, and surface area of inside
and outside of the shell stored in SAout and SAin of the rxnpool (desribed
below). Thus, diffusion helps the rxnpool to implements the equation:

<P>
       Sum over i (Conc1i-Conc2i)*Mean(area1i,area2i)/((len1i+len2i)/2)

<P>
Each diffusion element calculates<BR>
(Conc1i-Conc2i)*Mean(area1i,area2i)/((len1i+len2i)/2) for a pair of adjacent
rxnpools.  Their shared surface areas do not need to be identical. The mean
surface area is calculated as geometric mean, not arithmetic mean.


<P>
Each diffusion needs a pair of messages, one from each rxnpool (pool1 and
pool2).  Each message must contain the appropriate surface area (i.e. the area
of the surface facing the other rxnpool), the length of the rxnpool, and the
concentration. Each diffusion object then sends a pair of messages back to the
rxnpools,

enzyme implements a reaction pool (thus has many of the same fields as rxnpool),
and the two reactions of an enzyme reaction.  In the first reaction, enzyme
binds to substrate.  In the second reaction, product is formed and the enzyme is

<P>
Vmax units are quantity per time, where quantity units are the same as the
enzyme units (input from enzyme rxnpool).  Substrate and Km must have units of
Conc.  Product (quantity units, same as enzyme) = Vmax * E * S/ (S+Km).

<P>
Use addmsg from enz object to rxnpool RXN0MOLES product.  For more accurate MM
kinetics, enzyme OR enz object in kinetikit.  Feedback allows decrease in enzyme
activity as function of concentration of feedback substance.

<P>
hyperbolic form: feedback is proportional to: 1 / conc(feedback substance) for
negative feedback

<P>
feedback is proportional to: conc (feeback substance) for positive feedback.  

<P>
Sigmoid form: feedback is proportional to: conc/conc + halfmax (for inc

<P>
<STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>

<P>
Rxnpool is an object used to keep track of molecule concentration and quantity;
thus it interacts with reactions, diffusion, pumps,current, and calcium release
objects.  Regardless of the source of the molecules, it accumulates fluxes into
variables A (rate of change independent of concentration) and B (rate of change
proportional to concentration) and solves d[C]/dt = A - B*[C].

<P>
Inputs of concentration for 0th, 1st and 2nd order reactions are provided
through the messages RXN0, RXN1 and RXN2.  Inputs of Moles are provided through
the messages RXN0MOLES or RXN2MOLES. Inputs of current (uses physiologists
convention - that means a negative current is inward, e.g. a negative calcium
current increases calcium concentration.  To provide input from tabchannels
which use modelers conventation, provide a charge (valence) of -2 for calcium
(instead of +2). To provide input from either diffusion, CICRflux, an enzyme
reaction or a pump, use RXN0MOLES, because these calculate flux between
compartments (rxnpools) with unequal volume.  Thus, the change in concentration
is different for the two different compartments

<P>
rxnpool and all other chemesis objects allow for any consistent set of units.
Iunits is a value that specifies which units are used, thus if currents are in
units of nanoAmps, then Iunits should be 1e-9.  If current is in nA and the
clocks units are msec, then Iunits = 1e-12

<P>
Dunits indicates the units used for length (needed for diffusion).  units is a
value that specifies which units for quantity (e.g. moles, mmoles, etc) are
used.  type indicates whether to do the calculations in units of concentation or
quantity.  If type = 0, converts molecule inputs to concentration and then
integrates; if type = 1, converts concentration inputs to molecules and then
integrates.
