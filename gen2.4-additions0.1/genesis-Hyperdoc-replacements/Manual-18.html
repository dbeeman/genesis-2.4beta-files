<H2><A NAME="ss18.1">18.1 What is automated parameter searching?</A></H2>

<P>Most GENESIS simulations, especially highly realistic simulations of single
neurons, have large numbers of parameters which are not strongly
constrained by existing experimental data.  In such cases, the modeler has
to choose the parameters that cause the model to produce outputs which are
as close as possible to the outputs of the real system.  Doing this
manually is a very tedious process: typically one parameter at a time is
adjusted and the modeler sees if the simulation outputs are any closer to
the desired behavior than before.  Although a lot of insight can be
obtained this way, the nonlinear behavior of neurons and the strong
interactions between many parameters in creating neural behaviors make this
unnecessarily difficult.  In order to make parameter searching easier, we
have developed a library of parameter search objects and functions which
automate the search process.  Manual parameter searches that might take
months of boring work can often be done in a few days of automated searches
with no user intervention whatsoever, and the results will typically be
better as well.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss18.2">18.2 The parameter searching process</A></H2>

<P>First, the simulation whose parameters will be varied must be created and
debugged.  The modeler must then determine a way to compare the output of
the simulation with a desired output so that a numerical match value is
computed after each simulation.  Typically, the smaller the match value the
closer the simulation matches the data, with zero representing a perfect
match.  The modeler can create his or her own match function (in GENESIS
script language or in C code) or use one of the predefined match
functions.  Typical match functions for neuron outputs compare the times of
spikes, the shape of interspike interval waveforms, or both.</P>
<P>Then the modeler must create and initialize a ``paramtableXX'' object (see
below for what XX means).  This object contains tables of parameters and
can update these to give the next parameter set to try.  The initial
parameter values are set using the ``initparamXX'' functions.  Then the
modeler writes a function in the GENESIS script language to run the search.
This process is as follows:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Run a new simulation.</LI>
<LI> Calculate a match value.</LI>
<LI> Notify the paramtableXX object of the match value.</LI>
<LI>Tell the paramtableXX object to calculate the next set of
parameters.</LI>
<LI> Adjust the parameters of your model based on the new set of
parameters.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Once this is done, the function is called and the search begins.  Full
examples of this process for all the parameter search objects are included
in the parameter search demos in the Scripts/param directory.  We
<EM>strongly</EM> advise you to use these scripts as prototypes for your own
parameter searches, as this will make the process much simpler.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.4">18.4 Recommendations</A></H2>

<P>We recommend the SA method for simulations with small numbers of
parameters (less than 10), and either the SA or the GA method for
larger numbers of parameters.  The CG method can be used for very
simple or highly linear models, but experience shows that the SA
method can be as good or better than the CG method even in these
cases.  The SS method is mostly a historical artifact and is usually
not the best method to use.  The BF method is useful for an initial
mapping of parameter space, but not for the searching process per se.
See the documentation for the individual paramtable objects for more
detailed recommendations.</P>
<P>Your searches will be much more likely to succeed if the starting model at
least qualitatively matches the main features of the real system's
behavior.  To give an extreme example, you wouldn't use a one-compartment
model with simple Na and K Hodgkin-Huxley channels and try to match the
outputs of a Purkinje cell in a bursting mode.  The model should at least
be able to show some kind of bursting behavior in this case before you
began the search.  Similarly, if the cell shows strong spike frequency
adaptation the model must have channels that can do this too
(e.g. M-current or AHP potassium channels).  Automated searching can't make
a bad model good.</P>
<P>If possible, the matching function should be tailored to the data to be
matched.  For instance, in a rapidly adapting cell, matching the first few
spikes may be more critical than matching the last spike, which may have a
wide variation in timings in the real system.  Ideally a new matching
function should be written in C for each cell type, although this is not
always practical.  This can reduce the length of the search by heavily
penalizing models which are obviously incorrect and thus removing them from
consideration.</P>
<P>Note that the paramtable objects have many parameters of their own that can
affect the success or failure of a search.  Advice on these can be found in
the documentation for the individual objects.</P>
<P>It is very important to save the state of the search regularly, in case of
a computer crash.  All the routines have SAVE actions that should be
invoked regularly.</P>
<P>Searches that involve a lot of deleting of old elements will usually
cause some memory leaks, since GENESIS is not completely free of such leaks
yet.  It is vital to call ``reclaim'' after deleting a lot of elements or the
memory allocated to such elements will not be freed.  If this happens you
may run out of memory on your computer very fast!  Even with this
precaution, long searches can cause appreciable memory leaks, so that a
simulation which starts off at (say) five megabytes may grow to 10 or 15
megabytes or more.  This is especially true for large searches which take
days to run.  The best solution is to periodically save the state of the
paramtable object to disk, get out of GENESIS, and restore the state of the
object.  This can all be done from a shell script; examples are shown in
the demo directories.</P>
<P>Parallel GENESIS (PGENESIS) is very useful for parameter searching if you
have access to a parallel supercomputer (don't we all?  I have three in my
bedroom right now...).</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss18.5">18.5 Bug reports.</A></H2>

<P>Send all bug reports to Mike Vanier at mvanier@cs.caltech.edu.

Before you report a bug, read the bug reporting procedure, 
<A HREF="Manual-1.html#Bugs">Reporting Bugs</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss18.6">18.6 Caveats</A></H2>

<P>Wonderful though parameter searching is, modelers must always remember that
a parameter search can't find a good model if none exists in the parameter
space.  However, the failure of a parameter search to find a good match
often can be a clue that some important component is missing from the
model, which can be very useful information.</P>
<P>Becoming adept at parameter searching takes intelligence, practice
and experience.  In particular, understanding the different options in the
parameter search objects and knowing which methods work best under which
circumstance is non-trivial.  This is an ongoing area of research, and no
doubt more and spiffier methods will be developed in the future (maybe even
by you, the disgruntled GENESIS programmer!).</P>



<H2><A NAME="Paramtable"></A> <A NAME="ss18.7">18.7 Information about the Parameter-search (paramtable) Objects</A></H2>

<P>Parameter searching in the GENESIS `param' library is controlled by one of
the `paramtable' objects.  Each object implements a different search
algorithm.  The list of paramtable objects currently includes:
<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
</P>
<P>We cannot describe each of these methods in detail here; for more general
information about the methods (and comparisons between them) using a
variety of single neuron models, see the paper:</P>
<P>``A comparative survey of automated parameter-search methods for
compartmental neural models'' by Michael C. Vanier and James M. Bower,
Journal of Computational Neuroscience 7: 149-171 (1999).</P>
<P>The paramtable objects have two functions:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>To store parameter tables.</LI>
<LI>To calculate the next parameter set to simulate, given the results of
previous simulations.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The first function is quite similar for most of the methods, while the
second is completely different.  Here we will give general information
about the paramtable objects and briefly describe some of the common fields
and actions for these objects; for a full description of the individual
paramtable objects see the documentation for those objects.</P>

<H3>Actions</H3>

<P>Actions in paramtable objects are somewhat different from actions
elsewhere in GENESIS.  (See the documentation on 
<A HREF="Manual-8.html#Actions">Actions</A> for more information about GENESIS actions.}
Typically, GENESIS actions are called every time step under control of
the schedule (e.g. INIT and PROCESS actions), or are called by special
functions (e.g. the RESET and CHECK actions, called for all elements
by the "reset" and "check" functions, respectively). In contrast, many
of the actions in paramtable objects are meant to be called explicitly
e.g.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
    call my_paramtable_object INITSEARCH
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Thus, they are more like member functions in C++ i.e. functions that
``belong'' to a particular object.  These actions are often very different
from object to object, and most paramtable objects also have several
actions that are specific to that object.  Using actions in this way is
arguably an abuse of the GENESIS action mechanism, but since it works well
and there is currently no decent alternative, that's what was done.</P>
<P>Here are some actions that you should know about, which are in many of
the paramtable objects:</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
TABCREATE</TD><TD>Allocates memory for the paramtable object.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
TABDELETE</TD><TD>Frees previously-allocated memory.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
INITSEARCH</TD><TD>Initializes the parameter search process.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
RANDOMIZE</TD><TD>Performs some object-specific randomization process.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
EVALUATE</TD><TD>Evaluates a previously-simulated parameter set</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> given a numeric match value.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
UPDATE_PARAMS</TD><TD>Calculates the next parameter set to simulate.</TD></TR><TR><TD>

SAVEBEST</TD><TD>Saves a text file containing the best parameter set</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> obtained so far.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
RESTORE</TD><TD>Restores a binary image of the paramtable object.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
RESTOREBEST</TD><TD>Restores a text file containing the best parameter set</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD>obtained so far (not functional for all objects).</TD></TR><TR><TD>
DISPLAY</TD><TD>Prints a representation of a parameter set to stdout.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
RESTART</TD><TD>Restarts the parameter search process, preserving the</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> best parameter set obtained so far.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
ACCEPT</TD><TD>Copies the current parameter set to the locations for</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> the best parameter set.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</P>
<P>Some of these actions (e.g. TABCREATE) are used in other parts of GENESIS
for different purposes, and some (e.g. EVALUATE, RESTOREBEST) are not
currently used in all paramtable objects.  Most of these actions also
require arguments; for the specific syntax of the argument lists for each
action see the documentation for the individual objects.  Note that the same
action may require different arguments in two different objects, or may
have different optional arguments.</P>

<H3>Fields</H3>

<P>Here we briefly describe several fields that are present in most or
all of the paramtable objects, and that are involved in the actual storage
of parameter data.  Fields that are specific to particular methods will not
be mentioned; for them please see the documentation for the specific
paramtable objects.</P>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
</P>
<P>Many of the above fields are for bookkeeping only (e.g. the label field),
and some are set by the method and are readonly (e.g. the iteration_number
field).  The `search' flags are usually set by the `setsearch' function
(see 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#setsearch">setsearch</A>).  
The type, center, range, min, max, and label
fields are normally set by the `initparamXX' functions, where XX = {BF,
CG, GA, SA, SS}.  See the documentation for those functions for more details.</P>

<H3>Parameter types and parameter ranges</H3>

<P>Parameters come in two basic types: additive and multiplicative.  An
additive parameter is one whose value will be added to a starting value as
an offset.  An example of this might be an offset of the steady-state
activation curve
of an ionic channel (m_inf(V)), or a membrane potential offset.  For
instance, an additive parameter value of 0.002 volts might be added to the
midpoint of the activation curve of a sodium channel (which might be, say,
-55 mV to start with) to get a new midpoint of -53 mV.  This would make the
cell somewhat less excitable, since at a particular membrane potential
fewer Na channels would be open (ignoring inactivation).</P>
<P>A multiplicative parameter (the more common type) is a scaling value that
is multiplied by a starting value of a parameter to get the actual value.
An example of this would be the maximal conductance of an ionic channel
type in a particular compartment.  In this case, a multiplicative parameter
value of 2.0 might mean to multiply the starting value of a given ionic
channel by 2 to get the new value.</P>
<P>The reason for distinguishing between the two types of parameters is that
ranges are set differently for the two types.  A range of, say, 10.0 for a
multiplicative parameter with a center point of 1.0 means that the
parameter can vary from between 0.1 and 10.0.  Furthermore, a random value
in this parameter range is as likely to be below 1.0 as it is to be above
1.0.  This is accomplished by internally storing the parameter values as
the log of the true value.  Thus, a random value in this range is
calculated by choosing a value from the uniform distribution in (-log(10),
log(10)), and then taking the antilog of the resulting value.
Multiplicative parameters are natural for scaling factors from a starting
point, such as scaling factors for ionic conductances.  Additive parameters
are simpler: a center point of 0.0 and a range of 1.0 for an additive
parameter means the parameter is located in the range (-1.0, 1.0), as you
would expect.  Furthermore, a random value in this range is calculated by
choosing a value from the uniform distribution in (-1.0, 1.0), also as
expected.  Additive parameters are often used for offsets that can be
either positive or negative from a starting value, such as offsets in
activation curves or membrane potential offsets to compensate for an
unknown electrode junction potential.</P>
<P>At this point, you might be wondering what the big deal is.  If you want to
have a parameter representing a maximal conductance which is some value
between 100 and 200 Siemens per square meter, why not just set the
minimum value to 100 and the maximum value to 200 and be done with it?  In
fact, although it's not obvious, this is equivalent to defining an additive
parameter with a starting value of 150 and a range of 50.  If this is what
you want, fine.  However, sometimes you might want to start at 100 and be
able to select values from one-half to twice that value; that's a
multiplicative parameter.  Sometimes it doesn't even matter which type of
parameter you use.</P>

<H3>Writing parameter search scripts</H3>

<P>At the risk of sounding redundant, we <EM>strongly</EM> advise that you use the
sample scripts in the Scripts/param directory as prototypes for your
parameter searching scripts.  This is by far the easiest way to learn how
to use the parameter search objects, and can save you an enormous amount of
frustration.  It is also recommended that serious students read the source
code in the param subdirectory of genesis; the code is heavily commented
and reading it will clarify a lot of obscure issues.  If you're not used to
reading C code, this would be a good place to start :-)</P>


<H3>Modifying channel kinetics</H3>

<P>One common application of parameter searching is to modify the kinetics of
voltage- or calcium-dependent ionic channels.  This is especially important
when you use channels taken from one brain region for a cell in another
brain region for which the kinetic data for the channel in question has not
been established.  It is also useful when the kinetic data used to build
the channel is of questionable quality.  There are a number of ways you can
modify channel kinetics in a parameter search:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>   You can scale the time constants of the activation/inactivation curves
uniformly, making the channel faster or slower.  This can be used to
compensate for unknown temperature corrections among other things.  In
this case, one usually uses a multiplicative parameter centered on 1.0
as a scaling factor for the channel time constants.  The
``scaletabchan'' function in GENESIS is then used to actually modify the
kinetics of the channel (see the demos for examples).
</LI>
<LI>  You can shift an activation curve to the left or right with respect to
the X axis (usually voltage or calcium concentration).  Here one
usually uses an additive parameter centered on 0.0 as an offset factor
for the activation curve.  Again, the "scaletabchan" function can be
used to modify the kinetics.
</LI>
<LI> You can change the shape of the activation curve.  This is more
complicated, since in principle an arbitrary curve may need a large
number of parameters to describe it, but if the curve has some
standard shape (e.g. a sigmoid or a sum of sigmoids), the parameters
describing the curve can be used in a parameter search.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Note that if you use ``scaletabchan'' to shift an activation curve to
the left or right ((2) above), you must realize that GENESIS will get
rid of all values that are shifted beyond the range of the x-axis.
Thus, if you shift to the left and then later shift to the right you
will not necessarily end up with the same activation curve you started
with.  For this reason, we recommend recreating channels from scratch
for each iteration of a parameter search, and using parameters which
represent offsets from the starting activation curve in this case.
See the demonstration scripts in <EM>Scripts/param</EM> for examples
of this.  This does not usually cause a serious slowdown.  However, it
does lead us nicely into our final topic.</P>


<H3>Memory leaks</H3>

<P>When running a parameter search that creates and deletes channels (or an
entire cell) at each iteration of a parameter search, care must be taken to
avoid memory leaks, which can accumulate and eventually cause your computer
to run out of memory.  If this happens, your search will terminate
abnormally.  The most important things to remember are as follows.  If you
re-create a cell for each iteration of a search (which is often the best
way to go), you MUST delete the previously-created cell before creating a
new one.  You must also call TABDELETE on all tabchannels that were part of
the cell BEFORE you delete the channels themselves; it is NOT done
automatically for you.  Finally, you have to call ``reclaim'' for the memory
to actually be freed.  This is very lame, and we intend to do a much better
job in future versions of GENESIS, but for now, you have to live with it.</P>
<P>Even despite these precautions, there are some memory leaks which will
inevitably accumulate in parameter searches when you delete/restore cells
on each iteration.  Many of these have to do with string handling and there
is currently no way to avoid them.  We recommend that you run a parameter
search for a fixed number of iterations (say 1000), save the parameter
table, exit GENESIS, restart GENESIS and restore the parameter table and
keep going.  This can all be done from within a shell script; again, see
the demos for examples.</P>
