<P>GENESIS was designed to be extensible.
If you find that the objects provided by GENESIS do not serve your
modeling needs, you can modify the functionality of existing objects,
or create entirely new types.  Likewise, you can extend the set of commands
recognized by the SLI to include your own commands.
You may do either of these within the GENESIS scripting language, by
creating extended objects (see 
<A HREF="Manual-11.html#Extended">Extended Objects</A>)
and by defining script language functions.</P>
<P>However, there are occasions when you will need the computational
efficiency and speed gained by compiling new object and command definitions
into your own customized version of GENESIS.
The speed advantage of using a compiled object instead of a script-defined
extended object is most noticeable when it is necesssary to define a new
PROCESS action, as this action will be performed at each simulation step.
If the simulation requires many elements made from the object, then the setup
time for the simulation may also be longer when using script-defined objects.</P>
<P>A GENESIS object is simply a particular C structure definition that is
associated with a particular C function definition. Compiling these for use
by GENESIS is equivalent to compiling a new library.
When compiling new libraries into GENESIS, it is best to leave the
``official'' version of the <EM>genesis/src</EM> directory and its
subdirectories unmodified.  That way, you and other users will be able to
create private customized versions of GENESIS, without changing the standard
version.  Typically, you will create a directory to contain your customized
version of GENESIS, and one or more subdirectories to contain libraries for
your new GENESIS commands and objects.</P>
<P>There are two main steps involved in creating a customized version of GENESIS
which incorporates new commands or objects.  First, one must create a library
containing the the files which define the new commands or objects.  Then,
one or more libraries must be compiled into the new <EM>genesis</EM>
executable.  These two steps are described in
<A HREF="#NewObjects">Defining New Objects and Commands</A>
and 
<A HREF="#NewGenesis">Compiling a New Version of GENESIS</A>.</P>

<A HREF="#NewGenesis">Compiling a New Version of GENESIS</A>.</P>

<H3>Constructing the Library </H3>

<P>The files in the <EM>Scripts/newlib</EM> directory illustrate the
steps to follow in constructing a new GENESIS library:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Set up a directory to contain the new library and all of the code
files to go into it. For example:
<PRE>
     mkdir newlib
 
</PRE>

where 'newlib' will be the location of the new library.  As described under
<A HREF="#NewGenesis">Compiling a New Version of GENESIS</A>, this
directory should be created as a subdirectory of the one in which the new
version of GENESIS will be compiled.  The following steps refer to files
which are created within this library directory.
</LI>
<LI>Create an external header file.
The example file <EM>example_ext.h</EM> contains the lines:
<PRE>
     #include &quot;sim_ext.h&quot;
     #include &quot;example_struct.h&quot;
 
</PRE>

The file <EM>sim_ext.h</EM> is a specific GENESIS header file which must be
included.  It resides in the <EM>genesis/include</EM> directory, and includes
several other files which make a number of necessary definitions.
<EM>example_struct.h</EM> is a user-defined structure definition file which
must be created.
</LI>
<LI>Create the structure definition file.  
If new object functions are being added this file should be of the form
<PRE>
     #include &quot;struct_defs.h&quot;

     struct mystruct {
         TYPE
         fields ...
     };

     struct another_struct {
         TYPE
         other_fields ...
     };

     etc ...
 
</PRE>

The structure names (e.g. mystruct) are arbitrary but must not conflict with
any existing structure names.  ``TYPE'' specifies a list of basic object
fields.  It should be selected from one those defined in
<EM>genesis/include/struct_defs.h</EM>:
<PRE>
         ELEMENT_TYPE
         BUFFER_TYPE
         SEGMENT_TYPE
         CONNECTION_TYPE
         PROJECTION_TYPE
         CHAN_TYPE
         LINK_TYPE
         OUTPUT_TYPE
 
</PRE>

These are macros which define a set of fields depending on the class of the
object.  The ``fields'' of the structure are additional fields that are
completely user-defined.  When writing a new object definition, you will
pick one of the above types which most closely matches your needs and
supplement it with any needed additional fields.  For example, a new segment
class object might have a structure definition like:
<PRE>
     struct mystruct {
         SEGMENT_TYPE
         float   state;
         int     count;
     };
 
</PRE>

The <EM>newlib/example_struct.h</EM> structure file contains:
<PRE>
 #include &quot;struct_defs.h&quot;

 struct example_type {
     ELEMENT_TYPE
     float       input;
     float       output;
 };
 
</PRE>

You can find other examples in the <EM>genesis/include</EM> directory.
The documentation for each GENESIS object gives the name of the file
which defines its data structure.

If no new structure definitions are to be added, then simply create an
empty structure file. This can be accomplished using the UNIX shell
command
<PRE>
     touch &quot;my_struct.h&quot;
 
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Create the files containing C code to define any new routines or
objects.  Your .c files should contain shell functions of the form:
<PRE>
     do_myfunc(argc,argv)
     int argc;
     char **argv;
     {
     }
 
</PRE>

or object functions of the form
<PRE>
     MyObject(element,action)
     struct my_struct *element;
     Action *action;
     {
     }
 
</PRE>

The names of these functions are arbitrary as long as they do not conflict
with existing function names. If there is a conflict it will be reported
during the link phase of compilation as a multiply defined function. In
this case the function should be renamed. As a suggested convention, all
shell functions should be prefixed with ``do_''.

In the <EM>newlib</EM> directory, we have a separate file
(<EM>command.c</EM>) for the new shell function (to become a new
GENESIS routine) and another (<EM>example.c</EM>) for the new object
function.  These could have been combined into a single file, however.
Note that the shell functions look like any normal C function, except
that they must have two arguments, <EM>argc</EM> and <EM>argv</EM>,
which will be used to get the actual arguments passed by the Script
Language Interpreter.

The file <EM>newlib/command.c</EM> illustrates a simple function which will
be bound to a new GENESIS command which returns the number of arguments:
<PRE>
 #include &quot;sim_ext.h&quot;
 int do_example(argc,argv)
 int argc;
 char **argv;
 {
     printf(&quot;%d arguments passed to %s\n&quot;,argc,argv[0]);
     /*
     ** functions can return values which can be used in the interpreter
     */
     return(argc);
 }
 
</PRE>

Note that it begins with a required inclusion of the definitions in
<EM>sim_ext.h</EM>.

Source files which define object functions must also include a header
file giving structure declarations.  <EM>example.c</EM> accomplishes
this in a somewhat indirect way with the initial statement
<PRE>
    #include &quot;example_ext.h&quot;
 
</PRE>

Thus, <EM>sim_ext.h</EM> is included, as was done with
<EM>command.c</EM>, and an additional structure declaration file is
also included, as described in step 3.

The format for object functions is somewhat more complicated than that for
shell functions.  In the skeleton object function given above, the example
function ``MyObject'' takes two arguments: (1) the pointer to the instantiation
of the object structure (element) and (2) the pointer to the instantiation
of the structure that specifies the action to be performed (action).  Code
which selects and implements the various actions which can be performed
is given within the two curly brackets.

The code for the example object ``ExampleObject'' is listed below in ``An
Example Object Definition''.  It has detailed comments explaining how to
specify the actions performed and the way that messages are processed during
the PROCESS action.  The section on actions in 
<A HREF="Manual-8.html#Elements">Elements</A> describes the actions which are common to many GENESIS
objects.  In general, the best way to write an object function is to begin
by examining the source code for an existing object which is similar.  The
documentation for each object gives the name of the file and the name of the
function which implements the object.

</LI>
<LI>Create a library startup script.
Once you have written functions to define new GENESIS shell commands or
objects, you need to associate them with the command and object names
which will be recognized by the SLI.  This is done in a <EM>library
startup script</EM>.  The script is typically given a name of the
form <EM>LIBRARY_NAMElib.g</EM>, where <EM>LIBRARY_NAME</EM> is the name of the
library.  For the example we have discussed so far, the script is called
<EM>examplelib.g</EM>.  Although the file name is given the extension ``.g''
(for historical reasons), this is not an ordinary script which may processed
by GENESIS at run time.  Instead, it is processed by during compilation
by a program called ``code_g'', and it contains <EM>library startup
commands</EM> which are not recognized as GENESIS commands, and are not
listed by listcommands.

The following startup commands (described in the GENESIS Startup Command
Reference) are used in library startup scripts:

<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>
Command</TD><TD>Description</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<A HREF="Manual-24.html#addfunc">addfunc </a> </TD><TD>Binds a compiled C function to the name of a GENESIS command.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<A HREF="Manual-24.html#newclass">newclass </a></TD><TD>Adds a new class identifier to the list of object classes.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<A HREF="Manual-24.html#object">object </a> </TD><TD>Defines attributes of a GENESIS object and gives it a name.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD></TR></TABLE>


In addition, code_g recognizes the ordinary GENESIS command, addaction.
This command is described under 
<A HREF="Manual-11.html#Extended">Extended Objects</A>
and in the GENESIS Command Reference section.  In a library startup script,
it is used to add a new action name to the list of GENESIS actions, and to
associate a numerical value with it.  This same numerical value is used in a
case statement within the object function C code, in order to select the
action to be performed.

All four of these commands are illustrated in <EM>examplelib.g</EM>:
<PRE>
 addfunc example do_example int
 newclass        exampleclass
 addaction       NEWACTION       20
 object example_object example_type ExampleObject exampleclass device \
         -author         &quot;M.Wilson Caltech 2/89&quot; \
         -actions        RESET PROCESS NEWACTION \
         -messages       ADD 0           1 input \
                         SUBTRACT 1      1 input \
                         TWOARGS 2       2 arg1 arg2 \
         -readwrite input &quot;Input variable, altered by ADD and SUBTRACT&quot; \
         -readonly       output &quot;Running total of input at each step&quot; \
         -description    &quot;exercise in creating new objects&quot; \
                         &quot;keeps a running sum of its inputs&quot;
 
</PRE>

The first line associates the command name ``example'' with the function
do_example, defined in <EM>command.c</EM>.  The optional argument for the
data type (int) is needed here, because this routine returns an integer
value.

Next, a new class name (exampleclass) is defined, as well as a new action name
and associated number.  The final object command is continued over several
lines.  It is of the form:
<PRE>
     object name data_type function class [class] ... [options]
 
</PRE>

Here, the new object will be given the name ``example_object''.  In its
defining function (ExampleObject) it was given a data structure of type
``example_type'', defined in step 3.  The object may belong to more than
one class.  In this case, it is assigned to the newly defined exampleclass
and to the pre-existing device class.

It is required that any actions which the object performs be listed
following the ``<CODE>-actions</CODE>'' argument.  The code in
<EM>example.c</EM> gives the statements to be executed for the actions RESET,
PROCESS, and NEWACTION.

If messages are used by the object then the ``<CODE>-message</CODE>'' option must
be defined with the following arguments:
<OL>
<LI>the name of the message can be any string. This is used by the
addmsg command.  In this case, <EM>example.c</EM> defines ADD, SUBTRACT,
and TWOARGS.</LI>
<LI>the case number of the message type must correspond to the
value defined in the code definition (see the MSGLOOP of
<EM>example.c</EM>).</LI>
<LI>the number of arguments to the message.</LI>
<LI>the names of the arguments are arbitrary and are used for
documenting purposes (there MUST be as many names as there are
arguments).</LI>
</OL>

The names of the object fields (plus an optional descriptive string) are
given with one of the options ``<CODE>-readwrite</CODE>'',
``<CODE>-readonly</CODE>'', or  ``<CODE>-hidden</CODE>''.  These option names also
give the  protection that is assigned to the fields.  In this case, we
want to be able to set and inspect the <EM>input</EM> field.  As the
<EM>output</EM> field will be calculated by the object, it should be
readable, but not writeable by the user.  In other cases we may wish to use
fields for internal calculations, but keep them hidden from the user.
These are specified with the ``<CODE>-hidden</CODE>'' option.

The remaining fields are added for the purpose of documenting the
object and are optional.
</LI>
<LI>Create and Edit the library Makefile.  The <EM>genesis</EM> directory
in the GENESIS distribution (for example, <EM>/usr/genesis</EM>) contains a
file <EM>Libmake</EM> that is used as a template for the Makefile.  Copy it
into the library directory, giving it the name <EM>Makefile</EM>.
There will be a list of seven variables which must be set. These variables
are:
<OL>
<LI>GENESIS should contain the name of the genesis system files. For example
<PRE>
      GENESIS            = /usr/genesis
 
</PRE>

This is normally written into the Libmake file at the time GENESIS is
installed.  If GENESIS has been moved, or you are modifying libraries
provided by someone else, you should check to be sure that the path is
correct.
</LI>
<LI>LIBRARY_NAME is the name that you will use to refer to this library. It
can be any name which does not conflict with existing libraries. For
example using the specification in step 1:
<PRE>
     LIBRARY_NAME        = example
 
</PRE>

The LIBRARY_NAME will also be entered in the 'liblist' file residing in the
parent directory of the library directory, as decribed in 
<A HREF="#NewGenesis">Compiling a New Version of GENESIS</A>.
</LI>
<LI>STARTUP is the name of the library startup script, described in step
4:
<PRE>
     STARTUP             = examplelib.g
 
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>STRUCTURES is the name of the .h file containing the structure
definitions created in step 2. Only one filename is allowed. For example:
<PRE>
     STRUCTURES          = example_struct.h
 
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>EXT_HEADER is the name of the external header file created in step 1.
Only one filename is allowed.  For example:
<PRE>
     EXT_HEADER          = example_ext.h
 
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>TARGET_OBJ is the name of the of the object file which will be created
for the libarary.  This should be called LIBRARY_NAMElib.o, where
LIBRARY_NAME is the name of the library.  For example, with the
library ``example'', this would be:
<PRE>
     TARGET_OBJ          = examplelib.o
 
</PRE>

This name (with the path to the library) is also used for the USERLIB
variable in the Makefile (derived from Usermake) in the parent directory, as
decribed in 
<A HREF="#NewGenesis">Compiling a New Version of GENESIS</A>.
</LI>
<LI>OBJECTS is the list of object files (.o files) to be included in the new
library. The names of these files should be the same as the source code
(.c) files with the .c extension changed to .o.  For example, with source
code files <EM>command.c</EM> and <EM>example.c</EM>.
<PRE>
     OBJECTS             = command.o example.o
 
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="NewSynapticObjects"></A><A NAME="ss21.3"> 21.3 Creating New
 Synaptic Objects</H2>

<P>We anticipate that many GENESIS users will want to write variants of
the synchan and hebbsynchan objects to handle different kinds of
synaptically-mediated behavior.  Currently, this means that one has to
write a C function defining the object, usually in a user library.
See 
<A HREF="#Customizing">Customizing GENESIS</A> and 
<A HREF="#NewObjects">Defining New Objects and Commands</A> for more
information on this.</P>
<P>In general, one should start by copying an existing object that is as close to
the desired object as possible and then modifying it.  These modifications may
involve adding new fields or deleting old ones.  In order to guarantee that
the existing genesis commands for setting up synaptic connections work
properly with the new objects (e.g. planarconnect, volumeconnect,
planar/volumeweight, planar/volumedelay, etc.) we ask that aspiring synchan
hackers obey the following guidelines:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The structure definition for the new object should be of the following
form:
<PRE>
    struct MyWeirdSynchan_type 
    {
        SYNCHAN_TYPE
        /* use Synapse_type if using normal synapses */
        struct MyWeirdSynapse_type *synapse;
        /* ... put extra fields here if needed ... */
    };
</PRE>

</LI>
<LI>Some new kinds of synchans will have their own kinds of synapses with
extra fields not found in the standard synapses.  The way to define
these is as follows: 
<PRE>
    struct MyWeirdSynapse_type 
    {
      SYNAPSE_TYPE
      /* ... put extra fields here if needed ... */
    };

    typedef struct MyWeirdSynapse_type MyWeirdSynapse;
</PRE>


An example of both (1) and (2) is in
<EM>src/newconn/newconn_struct.h</EM>, with the definition of
HebbSynchan_type and HebbSynapse_type.  If your synapses are the same
as previously-defined ones, then this step isn't necessary.

</LI>
<LI>You must have code like this in the CREATE action of your synchan type:
<PRE>
    ...
      SELECT_ACTION(action)
        {

 21.4 Creating New Synaptic Plasticity Objects</H2>

<P>

<p>This documentation describes the implementation of the 'stdp_rules'
object, and how it may be used as a model for implementing synaptic
plasticity in a manner that is compatible with hsolve.</p>
<div class="section" id="background-synaptic-plasticity-and-hsolve">
<h1>Background - synaptic plasticity and hsolve</h1>
<p>The object-oriented paradigm for scripting simulations in GENESIS 2 is
one of its most attractive features.  By isolating cell variables and
parameters into separate objects that communicate with 'messages' it
is easy to modify, share, and reuse pieces of simulation scripts
without needing to understand most details of the simulation from
which they were taken.  This modularity has also made it possible for
users with a little programming expertise to easily add new commands
or objects to GENESIS for different types of synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the inefficiency of this message-based approach at
the implementation level. The GENESIS 2 'hsolve' object was developed
to bypass the object-oriented implementation and allow fast cable
model solutions, as well as much more efficient delivery of spike
events to synaptically activated channels.  The computational speed
increases when highly connected network models are simulated with
hsolve are impressive, typically a factor of 10 to 20.  However, the
price for this efficiency is that only a subset of the GENESIS objects
can be used with hsolve, and it is not possible to modify these
objects without major changes to the simulator code.</p>
<p>As a result, it is not possible to use hsolve with cells that contain
a facsynchan, hebbsynchan, or a new variety of synchan that is created
by following the procedure givem in Doc/NewSynapticObjects.txt.
However, the synapse (which is a substructure of the synchan) is not
directly used by hsolve, so it is possible to modify the weights of a
synaptic connection, and even to add extra fields in addition to the
weight and delay.</p>
<p>The concept behind the 'stdp_rules' object is very general, but this
particular implementation is specific to the Song, Miller, and Abbott
(2000) (SMA) phenomenological model of spike timing dependent
plasticity (STDP). Rather than using a more biologically based model
that depends on calcium influx to the cell, the weight modification
rules are based on experimentally observed relationships between the
timing of pre and postsynaptic spikes, e.g. Dan and Poo (2004). It has
been adapted for compartmental models with continous conductance
changes, Hodgkin-Huxley channels, and axonal delays, rather than for
'point neuron' integrate and fire (IF) cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-create-a-new-synaptic-plasticity-object">
<h1>How to create a new synaptic plasticity object</h1>
<p>The commented simulation code in src/newconn/stdp_rules.c can be used
as a model for implementing other types of synaptic plasticity.  For
example, a reimplementation of the facsynchan to be hsolvable would
use another algorithm and variables to modify the standard synchan,
but will have much in common with the code used for 'stdp_rules'.</p>
<p>In order to create another plasticity 'rules' object to modify synchan
weights, begin with by studying the notes below on 'stdp_rules', and
the demonstration scripts in Scripts/stdp_rules. The README file in
that directory describes a script function 'apply_stdp_rules' that can
be called with a clocked 'script_out' object to perform the same
synaptic weight modifications as 'stdp_rules'. It will be slower, of
course, but it can be modfied as a prototype for a new variety of
hsolvable plasticity rules. After testing and refinement, the
prototyped plasticity model can be compiled into an object in a new
GENESIS library, by following the instructions in Doc/NewObjects.txt.</p>
<p>You will want to study these files in src/newconn in order to understand
the relationship between the SLI script and the C code implementation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Makefile   -- adds stdp_rules.o to OBJECTS
newconnlib.g -- adds section for 'object stdp_rules stdp_rules_type StdpRules'
newconn_struct.h -- added '#include &quot;stdp_rules_struct.h&quot;'; changed SYNAPSE_TYPE
stdp_rules_struct.h -- defines struct stdp_rules_type for the object fields
stdp_rules.c -- the source code for StdpRules() and functions
synchan.c -- has additions to the 'EVENT' and 'RESET' cases
</pre>
<p>Modifications to synchan.c should be restricted to those that do not
affect the hsolvability of the synchan. In particular, no new messages
should be added, nor any changes to the PROCESS action. In this case,
synchan.c was modified to add the 'last_spike_time' field to each
synapse and set it to the time of the last presynaptic spike plus
delay in order to get the arrival time. This was done within the
'EVENT' case, where spike events are processed outside of hsolve.</p>
<p>Aplus and Aminus fields were added for use by stdp_rules or another
synapse modification object. The added field 'lastupdate' can be used
to store the time that the synapse weight, Aplus, and Aminus
fields were last updated. Other than initialization on RESET, these
three fields are not directly used by the synchan.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overview-of-stdp-rules">
<h1>Overview of stdp_rules</h1>
<p>The 'stdp_rules' object (see Doc/stdp_rules.txt) is a clocked object
(usually with a step of about 1 msec) that examines pre and post
synaptic spike times of a cell or list of cells, and changes the
weight of each synapse accordingly.</p>
<p>At each clock step, for the cell (or in turn for each cell):</p>
<p>It gets the 'lastevent' field of the cell's spikegen to find when
it last spiked.  Comparing it with the current time tells if it has
spiked since the last clocked call of the function, or when it last
spiked.  The same thing is done for each of the synaptic connections
to this synapse, by examining the 'last_spike_time' field of the
synapse, in order to find the most recent presynaptic spike arrival
time. For example:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">getfield <span class="pre">/cell[5]/dend/Ex_channel</span> <span class="pre">synapse[0].last_spike_time</span></tt></p>
<p>The relative timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes is used in
the STDP algorithm to adjust the weights.  In this implementation it
involves an exponential time window with a small number of parameters.
This gives higher negative or positive weight changes when the time
difference is small. (The change is negative if the pre-synaptic cell
fired later). For more details, see the Methods section of Song et
al. (2000).</p>
<p>In particular, note that the SMA algorithm adds each weight change to
an ongoing exponentially decaying change from previous spike events,
rather than adding it directly to the current weight.  This provides a
type of 'momentum' term to keep weight changes moving in the same
direction. Using this approach instead of using a simple increase of
weight by a fixed increment required the addition of the 'Aplus' and
'Aminus' fields to the synapse.  The differences between these
approaches to weight modification is discussed in the paper by
Morrison, et al. (2008) For a description of an implementation of the
SMA rules in Python using the Brian simulator, see Stimberg et
al. (2104)</p>

<H2><A NAME="NewGenesis"></A> <A NAME="ss21.2">21.2 Compiling a New Version of GENESIS</A> </H2>

<P>To compile a new version of GENESIS containing new user libraries:
<OL>
<LI>Create a directory from which to compile the new GENESIS.
You may do this by using the UNIX <CODE>mkdir</CODE> command
to create your own directory for containing the customized GENESIS.
</LI>
<LI>You need new libraries to add.  These will either be ones that you
have created yourself, following the directions in 
<A HREF="#NewObjects">Defining New Objects and Commands</A>, or existing libraries which have
been contributed by other GENESIS users.  The
<EM>Scripts/newlib</EM> directory contains an example of a
user-defined GENESIS library which you may use for testing these
instructions.  For now, we will assume that you have one or more library
directories.
</LI>
<LI>Create subdirectories for the libraries.  The libraries should be
contained in one or more subdirectories of the directory for the new GENESIS.
If you have existing libraries, use either the UNIX <CODE>cp -r</CODE>
(recursive copy) or <CODE>mv</CODE> command to put the library subdirectories
under the directory which you created in the first step.
</LI>
<LI>Create a ``Makefile'' for compiling GENESIS.  The <EM>genesis</EM>
directory in the GENESIS distribution contains a file ``Usermake'' that
serves as a template for this Makefile.  Copy it to the directory above
those containing your libraries, giving it the name ``Makefile''. Please note
that the Usermake file is subject to change with each GENESIS release.
If there is potential that users with different versions of GENESIS will
compile your library, provide a Makefile specific to each GENESIS release
(e.g. Makefile2.2.1, Makefile2.3).

At this point, your directory structure should look something like

<PRE>
                new genesis  --&gt; contains Makefile (from Usermake)
                      /\
                     /  \
                    /    \
                   /      \
          new library     additional new 
          subdirectory    library subdirectories
 
</PRE>


Each library subdirectory will contain its own Makefile constructed by
editing <EM>genesis/Libmake</EM>, as described in the Libmake file and in 
<A HREF="#NewObjects">Defining New Objects and Commands</A>.
</LI>
<LI>Edit the Makefile (copied from Usermake) as instructed by the comments
in Makefile.  


First, there is a definition for the variable GENINST.  The GENESIS
installation process should create the Usermake file with this set to
the full path of the genesis installation directory, for example:
<PRE>
     GENINST =       /usr/local/genesis-2.4/genesis
 
</PRE>

If, for some reason, the GENESIS files have been moved from the original
GENESIS installation directory, this line may need to be edited to reflect the
change.

Next, there are some instructions regarding assignment of the
system-specific variables, MACHINE, OS, XLIB, CC, CFLAGS, CPP, LD,
LINKFLAGS, and LEXLIB.  These should be set to the same values as
those used in the original <EM>genesis/src/Makefile</EM> when GENESIS
was compiled.

The following line,
<PRE>
     SIMNAME =       genesis
 
</PRE>

gives the name of the GENESIS executable that will be produced.  If
you would like to give it another name like <EM>mygenesis</EM> to
distinguish it from the standard version, you may change it here.
Next, we come to the USERDIR variable.  The instructions in the
Makefile say that this should give the names of any library
directories.  If we were compiling the single library in the
subdirectory <EM>newlib</EM>, we would say:
<PRE>
     USERDIR = newlib
 
</PRE>


The variable USEROBJ should give the pathnames
of any new library object modules.  After compilation, each
library will have a ``.o'' file which will be linked into GENESIS.
The instructions in Usermake tell us that this name is specified by
the TARGET_OBJ variable in the library Makefile.  For the example
given in <EM>Scripts/newlib</EM>, we would look in
<EM>newlib/Makefile</EM> (the library Makefile) and see that it is set to
<EM>examplelib.o</EM>.  We need to give the path relative to the place where
we are compiling the new GENESIS, so we would say:
<PRE>
    USEROBJ = newlib/examplelib.o
 
</PRE>


The remaining variable to set is USERLIB, which should give the
names of any new libraries.  The library name is specified by the
LIBRARY_NAME variable in the library Makefile.  Following through
with the newlib example, USERLIB would be set to
<PRE>
    USERLIB =example
 
</PRE>

This completes the edits to the Makefile.
</LI>
<LI>Check the contents of the libraries.  If you have constructed
the new libraries yourself, following the steps outlined in 
<A HREF="#NewObjects">Defining New Objects and Commands</A>, there
should be little else to do.  If you have received them from someone
else, you should check the line in each library Makefile that begins
with ``<CODE>GENESIS = </CODE>''.  This should give the full path to the
GENESIS distribution.  If it is not where you keep your GENESIS
distribution, change it accordingly.
</LI>
<LI>Type ``make'' from within the directory containing the Usermake-derived
Makefile.  If you have compilation errors, it is time to carefully review
the instructions!  To delete the temporary files which were created during
the compilation, type ``make clean''.
</LI>
<LI>Test the new commands and objects.  From within the directory in which
you compiled the new genesis executable, type ``genesis''' (or ``./genesis''
if your path has been set by a particularly paranoid system manager).
Now type ``listcommands'' and ``listobjects'' to see if the new commands
and objects have really been incorporated.

For the newlib example, you should find a new command called
``example'' and a new object called ``example_object''.  Give GENESIS
the command ``<CODE>echo {example 1 2 3 4}</CODE>'' and see if the results
are consistent with the comments in newlib/command.c.  The command
``<CODE>showobject example_object</CODE>'' should produce some information
about the new object.  You may execute the test script,
<EM>newlib/testexample.g</EM> to see if elements created from this
object behave as expected.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>If you have problems running or compiling the new version of GENESIS, you
should make sure that the files in <EM>genesis/lib</EM> were compiled under
the same environment (operating system and compiler) as your new library.  If
you suspect that this is not the case, you should recompile GENESIS,
following the instructions in <EM>genesis/src/README</EM>.</P>
