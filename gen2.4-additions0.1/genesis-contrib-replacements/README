genesis/contrib/README
======================

The genesis/contrib directory contains utilities, scripts, and other
files that have been contributed by users. It may also used in a personal
GENESIS installation for storing downloaded patches, updates, and other
material that has become available since the last GENESIS release.

*genesis-mode.el* - A useful emacs/xemacs macro for editing GENESIS SLI
scripts, contributed by Cengiz Gunay. It provides syntax highlighting
for GENESIS keywords, functions, and objects. It also gives automatic
indentation with the tab key, and a function index menu item. To use it:

  * copy the file into your ~/.emacs.d directory. 
  * If it is not autoloaded when Emacs starts, place the following lines
    in your ~/.emacs file::

       (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")
       (require 'genesis-mode)

  * If the '.emacs' file does't exist, create one containing just these two
    lines.

For XEmacs:

  * place genesis-mode.el under ~/.xemacs
  * add the following in your ~/.xemacs/init.el file::

    (load-file "~/.xemacs/genesis-mode.el")


*xemacs-mode* - An older set of emacs or xemacs macros by Hugo Cornelis.
This replaces the version in the GENESIS 2.3 release, and may have some
functionality that has not been incorporated into the new genesis-mode.el.
To use it:

1. Put the files in the genesis mode package somewhere in your
   home directory, e.g. in the directory "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/".

2. Put in your emacs initialization file::
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-vars.el")
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-langs.el")
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-mode.el")
   (load-file "~/genesis/xemacs-mode/genesis-files.el")

Alternatively, these can refer to the location within the contrib
directory, e.g.::

    (load-file "/usr/local/genesis/contrib/xemacs-mode/genesis-vars.el")

The xemacs-mode files are currently being incorporated into
genesis-mode.el. Later versions of genesis-mode.el may be
available at https://github.com/cengique/emacs-genesis-mode.
