This tutorial is a modified version of Mark Nelson's SQUID demo which
accompanied previous versions of the GENESIS package.  New features include
on-screen help, the ability to block (disable) channels, plotting of the
Hodgkin-Huxley activation variables, and the ability to generate phase
plots.  It is also possible to perform two-step voltage clamp experiments
with a conditioning pulse.

The simulation may be run by typing "genesis Squid" from the directory
in which these files reside.  The file 'squid.text' gives instructions for
running this tutorial.  The file may either be printed, or may be viewed
while running the demo by clicking the left mouse button on the box labeled
"HELP".

The file "exercises.text" gives some suggested exercises which may be used
with the tutorial.
