<h1 class="title">Modeling Calcium Reactions and Diffusion</h1>

<div class="section" id="a-tutorial-by-avrama-blackell">
<h1>A Tutorial by Avrama Blackell</h1>
<p>This directory contains tutorial scripts to teach how to develop models of
second messengers and calcium dynamics.</p>
<p>To model calcium we need to implement each of the mechanisms
controlling calcium dynamics (as explained in my lecture on calcium,
or in text books). Links to these are given in README.txt and README.html.</p>
<p>These mechanisms include:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>buffering - binding of calcium ions to various buffer molecules</li>
<li>diffusion</li>
</ol>
<p>c. various types of pumps which extrude calcium, the most prominent
being PMCA - and sodium-calcium exchanger.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="4">
<li>influx through voltage dependent channels.</li>
<li>release from the ER through IP3R and RyR receptor channels.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will build up these various mechanisms in a step by step using a
series of tutorials using example scripts.
A summary describing these scripts can be found in the README.txt file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-genesis-2-chemesis-tutorials">
<h1>The GENESIS 2 chemesis tutorials</h1>
<p>The first tutorial, illustrated with the script <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cal1-SI.g</span></tt>, guides you
through the creation of a single calcium - buffer reaction in the
soma.</p>
<p>We will be creating rxnpool objects which accumulate the fluxes of
molecules.  This is analogous to compartment objects that accumulate
the various ion fluxes tand then calculate voltage.t Also we will be
creating reaction objects. This calculates the change in molecule
quantities according to the kinetic rate laws.</p>
<p><em>Step 1:</em> Define the morphology of the soma, which is assumed to be
cylindrical (though this is not required).  First specify radius and
length.  Then calculate the volume and also the surface area.  This
latter would be required for membrane resistance and capacitance for a
compartment, but rxnpools are true 3D objects, thus concentration
depends on volume.</p>
<p><em>Step 2:</em> Create the rxnpool objects, one for each molecule.
somaCa will calculate calcium concentration from the fluxes
somaCaBuf will calculate the  concentration of the calcium-bound buffer.</p>
<p>We also need a pool for the free buffer.  We could either create a
rxnpool object, or, since we know that the free buffer = total
buffer - bound, we can createa conservepool object which implements
that simple equation.</p>
<p>In addition, to specify the morphology of these rxnpools, we must also
specify an initial concentration, and the units that we are working
in.  1e-3 is a factor times the SI unit, which paradoxically is mM for
concentration.  So, 1e-3 indicates we are working in micromole.</p>
<p><em>Step 3:</em> Create the reaction: Ca + Buf &lt;-&gt; CaBuf.  The forward
reaction has rate Kf, the backward reaction has rate Kb.  The reaction
object, called somacabufrxn, calculates Kf*Ca*buf, which is the
increase in CaBuf, and also kb*CaBuf, which is the decrease in CaBuf
(fluxes).</p>
<p><em>Step 4:</em> Set up the messages, because the reaction can't calculate
its thing without knowing the somaCa, somaBuf, and SomaCaBuf
concentration (stored in the field Conc).  The first two are
substrates (on the LHS of the reaction), but SomaCaBuf is a product.
We also need to send messages from the reaction back to the rxnpool
objects.  So, the somaCa needs to know the values calculated by the
reaction object.  Note that Kf*substrates (field kfsubs) will increase
CaBuf and decrease Ca, and vice versa for Kf*products (field
kbprods). Therefore, both fields get sent to both rxnpools, but in a
different order.  kfsubs is first when the message is being sent to a
product (LHS) and kbprods is first when the message is being sent to a
substrate (RHS).  The type of reaction is second order, indicated by
RXN2.  A first order reaction (decay proportional to concentration)
would be indicated as RXN1.</p>
<p><em>Lastly:</em> We set up the messages to the conservepool.  This object needs
to know the concentration of all other forms of the molecule, in this
case there are only two forms of the molecule, so the conservepool
just needs to know the CaBuf concentration.</p>
<p>This simulation initializes the somaCa at 1 uM, which is out of
equilibrium, and you can observe the decrease in concentration over
time.  Calcium (top graph) reaches its new equilibrium value with 0.5
msec.  The bottom graph shows the free buffer (red) and bound buffer
(blue).  Notice a tiny decrease in the free buffer, and on this scale
the increase in bound buffer looks small.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The second tutorial demonstrates how to implement calcium diffusion,
which occurs when a gradient exists between two compartments or more
compartments.  Thus, Cal2-SI.g guides you through the creation of two
calcium compartments connected by diffusion.  We actually will create
both calcium and buffer in both compartments. Cal2-SI.g extends Cal1-SI.g by
implementing the calcium-buffer reactions in two compartments - a
dendrite and soma.  NOTE: The script Cal2difshell.g implements the exact same
model using objects found in the src/concen directory.</p>
<p><em>Step 1:</em> The creation of calcium and buffer, and connecting them with a
reaction is so common, that it has been placed in a function (cabufSI.g)
which does all this for you when you provide the name and dimensions
of the compartment, as well as initial values for calcium, Ca bound
buffer, and total buffer.</p>
<p>[<strong>Note:</strong> calbufdifshell.g implements the same thing in genesis using
difshell and difbuffer objects.  The reaction is included in the
object, so there is no need to create a separate reaction object. ]</p>
<p><em>Step 2:</em> Again, specify the dimensions of the compartments.  This time
we have both a soma and a dendrite.  We do not calculate the volume
or surface area here, because that is done in the function.</p>
<p><em>Step 3:</em> Call the cabuf function which will create the calcium, Cabuf,
and free buffer objects, and set up the reaction between calcium and
buffer. We invoke this function once per compartment.  Notice that
this function is also calculating the surface area of the sides of the
cylinder.  This will be needed for the diffusion.</p>
<p>[<strong>Note:</strong> in Cal2difshell.g, we call the cabufdifshell function,
which is similar, but we also provide the diffusion constant]</p>
<p><em>Step 4:</em> Create the diffusion.  The diffusion equation is similar to
the cable equation, and is solved numerically in a similar way.
I.e. assume that each compartment is iso-concentration.  Just like
current flow depends on axial resistance, cross section, and the
voltage difference between compartments, so does diffusion.  In
particular, diffusional flux depends on the concentration difference
between compartments, decreases with the distance between the
compartment centers, and increases with the cross sectional area that
they share.  The proportionality constant is the diffusion constant.</p>
<p>First, create the diffusion object, call it somadend to indicate this
will calculate diffusion between the soma and the dendrite. This
object has a field for the diffusion constant, and another field for
units.  The diffusion object needs information (messages) from each of
two POOLs: both the soma and the dendrite in our case.  It is going to
calculate the concentration gradient between these two objects, hence
it needs the concentration of both.  In addition, the diffusion is
proportional to the surface area connecting the two compartments -
which is the surface area of the sides of the cylinder, which is why
this was calculated in the cabuf function.  Diffusion is inversely
proportional to the distance between compartments or length, so each
pool has to send this field to the diffusion object.</p>
<p>The diffusion object calculates the flux between the two compartments,
this has units of Moles (or micromoles), not concentration, because
the compartments might have two different sizes.  Also, it is a 0th
order reaction, i.e., the flux being sent into the rxnpool is not
proportional to the concentration in the rxnpool (that has already
been factored into the diffusion calculation), so the reaction order
and units are indicated by RXN0MOLES message type to the
rxnpool. Then, the rxnpool knows to divide the incoming flux by its
own volume to determine the change in concentration. Any increment to
one compartment implies an equal decrement to the other compartment,
so difflux1 = - difflux2, but difflux1 must go to POOL1 and difflux2
to POOL2.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> If using Cal2difshell.g, setting up the diffusion is quite simple: just send messages between the two calcium pools.]</p>
<p>For this simulation, we are setting initial concentration of the
somaCa out of equilbrium at 4 uM.  There is a very fast decrease to
0.00025 uM calcium (which you can see if you set xmax on /graph1/ca to
10).  After a long time, very little diffusion has occurred, so we
repeat this with diffusion of the  calcium buffers.  Then, you can see
a rapid increase in the dendrite calcium (black trace) and a slow
decrease in soma calcium (blue trace). The calcium approaches an
equilibrium value closer to the soma calcium value because its volume
is so much bigger.  The bottom graph shows the calcium bound buffer
for these same two cases, and its changes are qualitatively similar to
the calcium changes.  Diffusion of buffers is critical because most of
the calcium is bound to the buffers.</p>
<p>Just as multi-compartmental models don't work very well if you make
the compartments too big, diffusion is artifactually slow if the
compartments are too big. Typically, the compartments for diffusion
needs to be much smaller than those for electrical connections.  The
diffusion will better if you repeat these simulations with the smaller
dimensions that are commented out.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="cal7-g">
<h1>Cal7.g</h1>
<p>The next tutorial (we're postponing the tutorials on calcium release)
shows you how to connect a calcium permeable channel, e.g. a voltage
dependent calcium channel, to our calcium compartments.  In other
words, we are beginning to interface the electrical aspects of the
cell with the chemical.</p>
<p>[<strong>Note:</strong> Cal7difshell.g contains the code for implementing this
using genesis difshell objects.  It uses the cabufdifshell function,
and thus the diffusion is simpler.  Also, the name of the field
storing calcium concentration is different, so there are a few if
statements in icaTab.g so that the addmsg commands are correct.]</p>
<p><em>Step 1:</em> define both the dimensions of the morphology, and also the
electrical properties such as RA, RM and CM.</p>
<p><em>Step 2:</em> read in the function that createes pools of calcium and buffer,
either cabufSI.g (chemesis) or cabufdifshell.g (genesis)</p>
<p><em>Step 3:</em> compSI.g is a simple function to take the dimensions and
electrical parameters and make an electrical compartment object.  Note
that the units aren't quite SI because we're specifying morphology in
centimeters.</p>
<p><em>Step 4:</em> icaTab.g is the function to create the voltage dependent
calcium channel.  This function first defines the three most common
equations used for rate constants - exponential, sigmoid and linoid.
Then make_CaChan creates a tabchannel, and fills the tables with
voltage dependent rate constants given the half activation and
inactivation values.  make_CaChan can easily be replaced with any
function for creating a VDCC.</p>
<p>If this were a sodium or potassium channel, we'd be done now, but for
calcium channels it's better to calculate the driving potential using
a ghk object, which needs the calcium concentration.  The make ghk
function only creates the object, and messages, including calcium, are
setup in the next function: make_ica_ghk.</p>
<p>This function makes the tabchannel by calling the function
make_CaChan, then it makes the ghk object by calling the function
make_ghk.  Then assigns the Gbar from the specified gmax and surface
area. Note that GHK requires permeabilities, which are conceptually
the same as max conductances, but functionally and numerically
different.  The most important difference is that if you have a
working channel with a conductance tuned for you model, but want to
add a GHK object to the calcium channel, you need to make the gmax
about a million times smaller. The rest of this function sets up all
the messages.  Both the GHK and tabchannel need to know the
compartment voltage.  The GHK also needs to know external and internal
calcium concentration.  External calcium is typically a constant, but
internal comes from the calcium rxnpool object we will create.  The
GHK will need the Gk from the tabhannel - this represents the open
fraction, and then will calculate the current (and a psuedo Gk and Ek)
from the GHK equation.  These values get sent to the compartment
object for it to update its membrane potential.  Lastly, the current
and charge/valence need to be sent to the rxnpool so it can increase
its concentration based on the ion flux.</p>
<p>[<strong>Note:</strong> the messages are slightly different in Cal7difshell.g]</p>
<p><em>Step 5:</em> Now we will use these functions to create our model.  Just as
in Cal2.g, we invoke cabuf for the soma and the dendrite.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Step 6:</em> setup diffusion between the soma and dendrite, just as we</dt>
<dd>did in Cal2.g</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Step 7:</em> create a conservepool for the external calcium concentration.
This will just function as a constant for the GHK object.
[<strong>Note:</strong> for Cal7difshell.g, we use a neutral object to provide a constant
external calcium concentration]</p>
<p><em>Step 8:</em> create the electrical compartments - one for soma and one for
dendrite, and connect them with messages.  This could have been done
with the cell reader.</p>
<p><em>Step 9:</em> define the voltage dependent parameters for the calcium
channel, and call the make_ica_ghk function.  The part of this
function which makes the tabchannel can use any voltage dependent
calcium channel.</p>
<p><em>Step 10:</em> When I was writing chemesis, I created some ion channels
which employed physiologists convention, so my rxnpools expect that
inward currents are negatve.  But, tabchannels use modelers
convention - inward currents are positive.  To fix this discrepancy,
if you set Iunits to -1, (current units are negative amps) the
positive valued inward currents will be treated correctly.</p>
<p>[<strong>Note:</strong> These lines, setting Iunits to -1, are not needed using
the difshell, because it expects modelers convention]</p>
<p>Now, when you run the simulation, current injection of 10 pA will
activate the ion channel, causing calcium influx into the soma, which
will bind to the buffer, and more slowly diffuse into the dendrite.</p>
<p>First, look at the current graph.  CaT (blue) is the current out of
the tab channel object.  Notice that it reverses (becomes negative),
because the reversal potential was set to 60 mV in icaTab.  The
current out of the GHK object (red trace) doesn't reverse - this is a
characteristic of the GHK object and why it should be used (calcium
channels are not observed to reverse experimentall).  A reversed
calcium current could decrease the calcium concentration, but this
shouldn't happen.  Also, note that the CaT is scaled by a factor 1e6
greater than the CaT_ghk object.</p>
<p>The membrane potential looks funny because we don't have any other
channels in this neuron.  So, the calcium current causes a transient
increase to 100 mV, and then the potential decreases to a potential
still depolarized enough to allow re-activation of the current.  This
is probably caused by the calcium current no completely inactivating.</p>
<p>With each calcium &quot;spike&quot;, the calcium in the soma increases, though
by a very small amount.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Cal8.g</strong> is an example of how to extend this model to two dimensional
diffusion, and also allows you to explore how diffusion is affected by
how you subdivide electrical compartments into multiple calcium
compartments.  This cannot be implemented using difshells in genesis, because
difshell allows only 1-dimensional diffusion.</p>
<p><em>Step 1:</em> again define the dimensions of your compartment.  Note that if
you use the cell reader to create your electrical compartments, you'll
need to use getfield commands to get the radius and length to assign
your calcium compartments.</p>
<p><em>Step 2:</em> define the diffusion constant, initial calcium, buffer
concentration explicitly at the top of the file.  Placing these values
in a separate global parameter file would make it easier to change the
values to do simulation experiments.</p>
<p>Step 3: Define how many slices you want to place in your dendritic
compartment, and how many shells for subdividing your soma.  You'll
see how they are used below.  Note that calcium and buffer compartments
need to be much smaller than electrical compartments for diffusion to work.</p>
<p><em>Step 4:</em> just as in Cal7.g, define electrical parameters and read in
these functions.  Note that we're using cabufdiff.g.  This includes
both the cabuf function to create the reaction, and a diffusion
function - to create a diffusion object and set-up message between any
two compartments.</p>
<p><em>Step 5:</em> For the soma, we are going to create a series of shells, one
inside another.  So, we set up a loop.  With each pass through the
loop, we set up a calcium rxnpool, buffer rxnpool, and reaction
between them. Initially the outer radius of the shell is just the size
of the soma, but we decrement the outer radius by the height of our
shell with each pass through the loop.  The height is calculated from
the soma radius and the number of shells.  The second loop creates a
calcium compartment in each of the dendritic slices.</p>
<p>Step 6: set up the diffusion between all these shells and cylinders.
The first loop sets up diffusion between soma shells - note that the
number of diffusion objects is one less than the number of shells.
Then we create diffusion between the inner soma shell and the first
dendrite cylinder. The second loop sets up diffusion between each pair
of dendrite cylinders.</p>
<p>If we're creating a multi-compartment electrical model, we probably
want to put these loops into their own functions.  Then, set up a loop
through all electrical compartments, and invoke our functions to
create calcium cylinders or shells for each electrical compartment.</p>
<p><em>Step 7:</em> last, we're just creating our electrical compartments and VDCC
as we did in Cal7.g.</p>
<p>It would be much more interesting to implement these calcium cylinders
and shells within an electrical model that exhibited normal spiking
behavior.  You could even add a calcium dependent potassium channel,
to complete the feedback loop - from electrical to calcium channel to
calcium concentration to potassium channel to electrical activity.</p>
<p>Other extensions: neurons have multiple buffers.  How would you modify
cabuf.g to create two buffers, e.g. calmodulin and calbindin?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Cal3-SI.g</strong> and Cal4-SI.g explain and demonstrate how to implement calcium release from intracellular stores.</p>
<p>Cal3-SI.g extends Cal2-SI.g, so only the differences will be noted here.</p>
<p><em>Step 1:</em>
In the list of parameters, included are calcium and buffer in the ER,
as well as the maximal flux through the iicr channels.</p>
<p><em>Step 2:</em>
After creating rxnpools and reactions in soma and dendrite, we also
create them in the soma ER.  Optionally, you could add another line
creating an ER in the dendrite.</p>
<p><em>Step 3:</em>
After setting up diffusion between soma and dendrite, we now setup the
ip3 induced calcium release according to the DeYoung and Keizer
model. It will be easier to understand this if you review the DeYoung
Keizer model, as presented in the Li &amp; Rinzel 1994 paper. This is an 8
state channel.  In an ideal world, there would be a single markov
kinetic channel object representing all 8 states.  But since there
isn't, we use the cicr object, and create 8 of them, each one
representing a single state.  A single channel can be in one of 8
states, of which only one is open and conducting.  Transitions between
the states depend on the calcium (changing beta or gamma state) or ip3
(changing alpha state) concentration.  Thus, each of these objects
needs a message from either ip3 concentration or calcium
concentration, and the forward rate (alpha, beta or gamma) multiplies
the concentration.  xinit is the initial value, xmin and xmax should
be 0 and 1 since x represents the fraction of channels in that
state. Cal3-SI.g shows you how to setup two of the states, and add
messages between those two states.  The function iicrfunc.g contains
the code to setup all 8 states.  Note that this object can be used to
create a 4 state ryanodine receptor channel.  After setting up all 8
channel states, one more object/element is needed to calculate the
flux through the channel.  This is created in the makeiicrflux
function, which creates a cicrflux element that calculates calcium
flux through the channel as a function of the calcium gradient
(between ER and cytosol) and the fraction of open channels.  It also
adds all the calcium and ip3 messages.</p>
<p>When you run this simulation, calcium and calcium bound buffer will
increase due to release from stores.  The fraction of iicr channels in
the open state (x110) will increase and then decrease, and the
fraction of iicr channels in the closed and calcium bound states will
increase.  You will not see them decrease again because there are no
calcium extrusion mechanisms.</p>
<p>Cal4-SI.g extends Cal3-SI.g by adding the submembrane pumps, which
extrude calcium.  Binding to buffer doesn't eliminate the calcium, it
just temporarily inactivates a large fraction of it.  The plasma
membrane pump ultimately must eliminate the calcium from the
cell. calpumpSI.g contains functions for creating a Michaelis-Menton
style pump (MMpump), used to model the plasma membrane and smooth
endoplasmic reticulum ATPase pumps (SERCA and PMCA).</p>
<p>Note that the parameters are no longer in this file, they have been
moved to const.g Similarly, creation of calcium release objects are no
longer in this file, they are created by calling the makeiicr
function, and then the makeiicrflux function.</p>
<p>The pump on the ER membrane is called the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
calcium ATPase (SERCA) The formulation of Michaelis-Menton style pumps
results in an equilibrium calcium concentration of zero.  To have a
non-zero calcium, we need a compensatory leak back into the cytosol.
The leak is a constant flux of calcium depending on the calcium
concentration.  It is possible to calculate the proper leak from the
equilibrium calcium, external calcium, and release flux.  Then, the
leak is created using a cicrflux object (in calpumpSI.g, but with an
IP3R message of 1.0 (constant).</p>
<p>When you run these simulations, calcium will increase, and then begin
to decrease because of the pump.</p>
