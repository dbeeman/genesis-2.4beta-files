This simulation (by Sharon Crook, U. of Maryland) is designed to allow you
to study the activation patterns and emergent behavior of a simple neuronal
network of four cells.  Each model cell consists of two compartments: a soma
compartment which corresponds to the axon hillock of the soma where action
potentials are generated, and a dendrite compartment.  The soma compartment
contains ionic channels for sodium (Na) and potassium (K) with voltage
dependent conductances obeying Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics.  The dendritic
compartment has chemically activated excitatory and inhibitory channels.
The simulation allows you to set any pattern of connections between the
cells, using either excitatory or inhibitory connections.  The parameters
which determine the equilibrium potentials of the channels and the time
dependence of the channel conductances in the dendrite may be modified
during the simulation.  To run the tutorial, type "genesis CPG" and select
RUNNING THE SIMULATION on the Help menu.  A more detailed description of the
model is given under the MODEL PARAMETERS help menu selection.
