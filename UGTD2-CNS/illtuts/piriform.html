<H1>Tutorial 7 - Piriform</H1>
<P>
The Piriform simulation studies the dynamical properties of cortical
networks.  It was written by Alexander Protopapas and is a "user-friendly"
version of the research simulation used by <A HREF="refs.html">Wilson and
Bower (1992) and Protopapas, et al. (1998)</A> to model the processing of
olfactory inputs to the piriform corex.  This scaled-down version of the
original GENESIS simulation uses 135 each of pyramidal cells, feedforward
and feedback inhibitory interneurons, arranged in a 9 x 15 array.  The use
of this tutorial and the background for understanding it is provided in
Chapter 9 of The Book of GENESIS.

The local connections in the piriform cortex model are shown in the neural
circuit diagram at the left.  Clicking the mouse on a given
synapse in the diagram brings up a menu for changing the synaptic weight and
time constant.  The mouse is also used to select various modes of displaying
the simulation results.
<P>
In the simulation results shown here, the upper graph has been used to
display the superimposed field potentials due to the synaptic currents
in the <i>supIb</i> and <i>deepIb</i> layers.  The middle graph shows
the simulated full field EEG pattern.  The lower graph shows the spike
activity in the pyramidal cells as a function of time.  This is useful in
correlating the activity of a particular cell type with the EEG pattern.
<P>
The colored columns at the upper right may be used to represent the
activity (membrane potential, synaptic conductance, or transmembrane
current) in each compartment of a row of pyramidal cells.  Here we are
seeing a view of membrane potential in the 15 cells of row 5 of the
network.  The network display at the lower right has been selected to
represent the synaptic conductances in the <i>supIb</i> layer.  These
arise from the caudally directed association fibers.  Here we see a wave
of activity propagating from rostral to caudal.  this activity was provoked
by random input from the LOT and has a frequency of about 40hz.
