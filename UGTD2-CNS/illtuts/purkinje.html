<H1>Tutorial 9 - Purkinje Tutorial</H1>
<P>
The Purkinje cell tutorial implements the full
<A HREF="refs.html">De Schutter and Bower (1994)</A>
detailed model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell.
This advanced tutorial, by Erik De Schutter and Hugo Cornelis, was
created since the publication of the Book of
GENESIS.  It assumes that you have a basic knowledge of the Purkinje cell and
its synaptic inputs, as described in De Schutter and Bower (1994).
The tutorial gives visual insights in how different properties
as concentrations and channel conductances vary and interact in a real
Purkinje cell under a variety of input conditions.
