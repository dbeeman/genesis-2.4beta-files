<H1>Tutorial 2 - Squid</H1>
<P>
The second tutorial, created by Mark Nelson, and described in Chapter 4
of The Book of GENESIS, lets one perform voltage or
current clamp experiments on a compartment containing Hodgkin-Huxley
channels.  The tutorial also provides the ability to block channels, to plot
the Hodgkin-Huxley activation variables, and to generate phase plots.  The
accompanying exercises help the student understand the Hodgkin-Huxley model
and the procedure used to calculate rate parameters from voltage clamp
experiments.  Other exercises elucidate the basis of post-inhibitory rebound
and refractory period.

UPPER LEFT shows the both the "command voltage" which is applied to the
voltage clamp circuitry and the resulting membrane potential.  A step from
the resting potential (defined to be 0 mV) to 50 mV is applied after 10
msec.

<p>
LOWER LEFT plot shows the injection current used to maintain this voltage.
The very sharp initial spike is due to the large current needed to quickly
charge the membrane capacitance to the clamp voltage.  It is followed by an
inward Na current, shown as a negative current here, then an outward K
current.

<p>
The channel conductance plots at the UPPER RIGHT reveal a rapid rise
in the Na conductance, followed by a slower decay as it becomes
inactivated.  The K current has a much slower activation and no
inactivation.  It doesn't decay until the voltage is dropped back to
zero.  These conductance changes result in the channel currents shown
in the LOWER RIGHT plots.  As the Na equilibrium potential is greater
than the resting potential, the Na current flow is inward (negative).
The superposition of these two currents, plus the initial capacitive
current give the injection current. (LOWER LEFT).
From these, we can calculate the behavior of the channel activation and
inactivation parameters.
