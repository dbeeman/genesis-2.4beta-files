<H1>Tutorial 3 - Neuron</H1>
<P>
The Neuron tutorial is incorporates features of the previous two
simulations in order to allow one to explore temporal and spatial summation
of synaptic inputs.  It is explored in Chapter 6 of The Book of GENESIS.

Description:
<P>
A portion of the screen display for the Neuron tutorial.  The HELP window at
the top shows a diagram of the model neuron, and the types of inputs which
are available.  Part of the "control" panel is shown at the bottom, with
buttons and dialog boxes to control the simulation.  Other buttons invoke
popup menus to control most model parameters and the timing of the various
types of inputs.
