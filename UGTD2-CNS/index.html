<P> 
The "Ultimate GENESIS Tutorial Distribution" serves as both a distribution of
GENESIS 2.4 and a self-paced course on biologically realistic modeling in
general, and creating simulations with GENESIS in particular.  It brings
together material that is available as separate downloads from the GENESIS web
site and through the GENESIS Users Group.  It includes several
simulator-independent tutorials on biologically realistic neural modeling, as
well as both tutorial and research simulations that have been implemented with
GENESIS.  The extended Tutorials package includes course material used at
several international courses on neural modeling and a "Getting Started With
Realistic Neural Modeling" guide, with suggested exercises for self-paced study.
The files here are organized in a manner suitable for burning the "UGTD" to a
CDROM or memory stick for course use.  <A HREF="UGTD_1.1_label.png">Here is an

<P>
The latest version of this package will be available at
<A HREF="http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/UGTD.html">
http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/UGTD.html</A>.

<P>
This update of the June 2009 version contains additional network simulations,
new Python tools, and exercises to go with the tutorials that were used for the
January 2014 Latin American School on Computational Neuroscience (LASCON).

<H2>Other Documentation and Tutorials</H2>

<P> <A HREF="Tutorials/genprog/genprog.html">The GENESIS Modeling Tutorial
</A>.  This is the main tutorial for modeling with GENESIS. It is
intended to be a "quick start" to creating simulations with
GENESIS. It should give you the tools and enough information to let
you quickly begin creating cells and networks with GENESIS, making use
of the provided example simulations.

<P>
<A HREF="Tutorials/iBoGpdf/index.html">PDF version of "The Book of
GENESIS"</A> This is frequently referenced in the GENESIS Modeling Tutorial.

<A HREF="Tutorials/cnslecs/cnslecs.html">An Introduction to Computational
Neuroscience</A>
- These are introductory lectures on computational neuroscience and
realistic neural modeling.  It has sections on the Hodgkin-Huxley model and
compartmental modeling that might be useful to those who are studying them
for the first time, or who need some review.

<H2>Tutorial simulations included with GENESIS</H2>

<P> The genesis/Scripts directory in any of the unpacked GENESIS
distribution archive files contains many example simulation scripts,
including those used in the
<A HREF="Tutorials/iBoGpdf/index.html">Book of GENESIS</A>.
Some of these illustrate GENESIS features and techniques
for programming simulations.  Others are interactive tutorials
for teaching concepts in neurobiology and neural modeling.  As their use
requires no knoweldge of GENESIS programming, they are suitable for use in
a computer simulation laboratory which would accompany upper division
undergraduate and graduate neuroscience courses.  Each of these has on-line
help and a number of suggested exercises or "experiments" which may be
either assigned as homework or used for self-study.  These tutorials may
also be taken apart and modified to create your own simulations, as they
are reasonably well commented.  Several of them are derived from existing
research simulations.<P>
