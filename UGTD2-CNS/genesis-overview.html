<H1>Overview of GENESIS</H1>
<P>
The GEneral NEural SImulation System was designed to allow the consctruction
of biologically realistic simulations at many different levels, from
subcellular components and biochemical reactions to
complex models of single neurons, simulations of large
networks, and systems-level models.

<P>
The design of the GENESIS simulator and interface is based on a "building
block" approach.  Simulations are constructed from modules that receive
inputs, perform calculations on them, and then generate outputs.  Model
neurons are constructed from these basic components, such as compartments.
and variable conductance ion channels.  Compartments are linked to their
channels and are then linked together to form multi-compartmental neurons
of any desired level of complexity.  Neurons may be linked together to form
neural circuits.  This object-oriented approach is central to the
generality and flexibility of the system, as it allows modelers to easily
exchange and reuse models or model components.  In addition, it makes it
possible to extend the functionality of GENESIS by adding new commands or
simulation components to the simulator, without having to modify the
GENESIS base code.

<P>
GENESIS uses a high-level simulation language to construct neurons and
their networks.  Commands may be issued
either interactively to a command prompt, by use of simulation
scripts, or through the graphical interface.  A particular simulation
is set up by writing a sequence of commands in the scripting language
that creates the model itself and the graphical interface for a
particular simulation.  The scripting language and the modules are
powerful enough that only a few lines of script are needed to specify a
sophisticated simulation.  The principal components of the simulation
system and the various modes of interacting with GENESIS are
illustrated below.

<P>
The underlying level of the GENESIS user interface is the Script Language
Interpreter (SLI).  This is a command interpreter similar to a Unix system
shell with an extensive set of commands related to building, monitoring and
controlling simulations. GENESIS simulation objects and graphical objects
are linked together using the scripting language.  The interpreter can read
SLI commands either interactively from the keyboard (allowing interactive
debugging, inspection, and control of the simulation), or from files
containing simulation scripts.

<P>
The graphical user interface (GUI) is XODUS, the X-windows Output and
Display Utility for Simulations.  This provides a higher level and
user-friendly means for developing simulations and monitoring their
execution.  XODUS consists of a set of graphical objects that are the same
as the computational modules from the user's point of view, except that
they perform graphical functions.  As with the computational modules, XODUS
modules can be set up in any manner that the user chooses to display or
enter data.  Furthermore, the graphical modules can call functions from the
script language, so the full power of the SLI is available through the
graphical interface.  This makes it possible to interactively change
simulation parameters in real time to directly observe the effects of
parameter variations.  The mouse may also be used to plant recording or
injection electrodes into a graphical representation of the cell.  In
addition to provisions for plotting the usual quantities of interest
(membrane potentials, channel conductances, etc.), XODUS has visualization
features that permit such things as using color to display the propagation
of action potentials or other variables throughout a multi-compartmental
model, and to display connections and cell activity in a network model.

<P>
The "GENESIS Simulation Engine" consists of the simulator base code
that provides the common control and support routines for the system,
including those for input/output and for the numerical solution
of the differential equations obeyed by the various neural simulation
objects.

<P>
In addition to receiving commands from the SLI and the GUI, the
simulation engine can construct simulations using information from
data files and from the pre-compiled GENESIS object libraries.
For example, the GENESIS "cell reader" allows one to build complex
model neurons by reading their specifications from a data file,
instead of from a lengthy series of GENESIS commands delivered to the
SLI.  Similarly, network connection specifications may be read from a
data file with the "fileconnect" command.

<P>
The GENESIS object libraries contain the building blocks from which many
different simulations can be constructed.  These include the spherical and
cylindrical compartments from which the physical structure of neurons are
constructed, voltage and/or concentration activated channels,
dendro-dendritic channels, and synaptically-activated channels with
synapses of several types including Hebbian and facilitating synapses.  In
addition, there are objects for computing intracellular ionic
concentrations from channel currents, for modeling the diffusion of ions
within cells (e.g., concentration pools, ionic pumps, and buffers), and for
allowing ligand gating of ion channels (e.g., magnesium blocking for NMDA
channels).

<P>
There are also a number of "device objects" that may be interfaced to
the simulation to provide various types of input to the simulation
(pulse and spike generators, voltage clamp circuitry, etc.) or
measurements (peristimulus and interspike interval histograms, spike
frequency measurements, auto- and cross-correlation histograms, etc.).
