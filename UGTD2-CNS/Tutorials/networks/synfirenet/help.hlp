                               USING HELP

Many of the topics on the help menu use text windows like this one.  If
there is more than one screen full of text, move the cursor into the scroll
bar at the left edge of the window, hold the left mouse button down, and
drag the mouse downwards to scroll through the text.  When you have
finished, click the left button on the "DONE" box.

The Help Menu selections are as follows:

USING HELP--gives this message.

VIEW THE README FILE--displays the "README" file, giving information
     about the simulation.

RUNNING THE SIMULATION--tells how to use the various buttons and dialog
     boxes and describes the plots which are produced. It also tells how
     to set the soma injection currents, how to change or create both
     excitatory and inhibitory connections between cells, and how to 
     manipulate the simulation windows.

MODEL PARAMETERS--tells something about the physical and mathematical model
     used for the neurons and describes the various parameters which may be
     set during a simulation.

THINGS TO TRY--suggests parameters to try in order to simulate various
     possible phenomena.

QUIT HELP--makes the help menu disappear.
