  MODEL DESCRIPTION
  -----------------
  
  Each of the 100 cells has Na and K channels as well as an excitatory and
  inhibitory synapse.  The cells are connected to each other by columns, 
  where 10 cells make one column and make input onto the next column of
  10 cells.

  The parameters used in the model can be seen and modified by editing the
  scripts netsim.g, cell.g, and connections.g.
