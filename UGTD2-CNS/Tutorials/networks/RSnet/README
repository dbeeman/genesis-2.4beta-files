RSnet is a demonstration of a simple network, consisting of a grid of
simplified neocortical regular spiking pyramidal cells, each one coupled with
excitory synaptic connections to its four nearest neighbors.  This might model
the connections due to local association fibers in a cortical network.

The example simulation was designed to be easily modified to allow you to use
other cell models, implement other patterns of connectivity, or to augment
with a population of inhibitory interneurons and the several other types of
connections in a cortical network.  Details of running the simulation and
understanding the scripts are in the "Creating large networks with GENESIS"
section of the GENESIS Modeling Tutorial, Tutorials/genprog/net-tut.html.

The cell model used in this network is described in the cells/RScell
directory.
