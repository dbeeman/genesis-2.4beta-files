The simulation is launched by typing
genesis main.g

After that, the simulation can be started for a certain time t by typing
step t -time
at the GENESIS prompt, where t is in seconds. 
Alternatively, the simulation can be started for a certain number of
time  steps n by typing 
step n

In order to produce data stored in ascii-files, you have to create
a directory DATA before starting the simulation with the step
command. Since the simulation does not provide any direct graphical
output, you should store data to ascii-files and visualize it by means
of e.g. Matlab or xplot.

If your computer has problems to handle many outputfiles, you can
reduce their number in the file ascii_output41.g, by e.g. reducing the
counters. Somatic membrane potentials of selected cells and
extracellular potentials recorded by simulated electrodes are stored
by means of this file. The file spikehist2409.g creates another set of
ascii-files, where only the points in time of spike-initiation of
selected cells get stored.

About the other files:
======================
The core of the simulation is the file main.g. This file imports
everything else. The comments should guide your way. The
second most important file is maybe constants41.g. Almost every constant
needed is defined in this file. The cell descriptor files are
implicitely imported by the readcell-commands in cell_arrays41.g.

Currently, I use hsolve with chanmode 1. Integration method is Crank-
Nicolson.
I run the simulation on a SGI with XEON-processor under Linux Suse 7.3 and GENESIS
2.2, but none of the new features of GENESIS 2.2 is applied.
A simulation of 100 msec takes approximately 5 minutes on the above
mentioned machine.

For more information about the set-up of the simulation, please have a look at
my diploma thesis, Chapter 2.


Enjoy!
