This is a small hippocampal network model consisting of 72 pyramidal cells
(Traub 1994 model) and 18 interneurons (Traub 1995 model), developed and
submitted to BABEL, the GENESIS Users Group, by Kerstin Menne, and
published  in

Menne, K.M.L., Folkers, A., Malina, T., Maex, R. and Hofmann, U. G. (2002)
Test of spike sorting algorithms on the basis of simulated network data.

The contents of her README file are appended below.  To save space, the
video files (pans and zooms of cell visualizations) and the large data
files in the DATA directory have been removed from this version.
DATA/README has been preserved here as README_DATA.

What's this?
------------

Everything you have to know about my biologically realistic simulation
of a part of hippocampal CA3.

Paper and diplomathesis (Menne_*.pdf) contain detailed information
about the why and how of the simulation.

The directory SIMULATION contains the simulation scripts
themselves. Please have a look at the README file.

The directory DATA contains examplary network output. Please refer to
the README file for an explanation.

And finally, the movies are for illustrative purposes.

Enjoy!
