This directory contains the documented GENESIS network model simulations:

<P> <A HREF="RSnet/index.html">RSnet/</A> - RSnet is a demonstration of a
    simple network, consisting of a grid of simplified neocortical regular
    spiking pyramidal cells, each one coupled with excitory synaptic
    connections to its four nearest neighbors.  It is described and
    analyzed in the GENESIS Modeling Tutorial section
<A HREF="../genprog/net-tut.html">"Creating large networks with
GENESIS"</A>.

<P> <A HREF="par-RSnet/index.html">par-RSnet/</A> - par-RSnet is the version of
RSNet for parallel GENESIS, and can be run with PGENESIS on PCs with
multicore processors.  It is described and analyzed in the GENESIS Modeling
Tutorial section <A HREF="../genprog/par-net-tut.html">"Converting large
network simulations to PGENESIS" </A>.

<P>
<A HREF="synfirenet/index.html">synfirenet/</A> - Contains an example of a
    more abstract type of network connectivity, the synfire chain.  These
    scripts were developed by Dieter Jaeger as as an exercise in script
    programming of networks, and the scripts were designed to be easily
    modified.  The network model also allows Hebbian learning.  The main
    script is netsim.g.  The GUI lets you experiment with the model, and
    the HELP menu offers suggestions on ways to modify the model.  The
    README file explains about synfire chains and the details of this
    model.

<P>
<A HREF="Vogels-Abbott_net/index.html">Vogels-Abbott_net/</A>
 - Contains the GENESIS implementations of the Vogels and Abbott (2005)
 model using single compartment neurons with Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics.  This
 was used as a benchmark for neural simulators in the review by Brette et
 al.  (2007).

<P>

package:</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="VAnet2/README.html"> VAnet2 model</A> - An
efficient hsolved GENESIS version of the Vogels and
Abbott (2005) model.  It serves as a tutorial on the use of hsolve to
achieve at least a factor of 10 speedup, in the context of a very
simple model.  The 'VAnet2-batch.g' script is intended to be extended
for testing GENESIS spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
implementations with hsolve. This script would be a good starting
point for models that use more realistic cells and connections.

<P><A HREF="ACnet2-GENESIS/README.html">ACnet2</A>
is an auditory cortex model that also serves as a tutorial and template
for creating neocortical network models.
<P>

The fMRInet model, which is available at
<A HREF="http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/fMRInet">
http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/fMRInet</A> illusrates how to provide
unusual stimuli, such as the effects of electromagnetic fields, by
using a 'script_out' object to provide the stimulus at clocked intervals.

<P>

<A HREF="hippo2/index.html">hippo2/</A> - This is a small hippocampal
network model consisting of 72 pyramidal cells (Traub 1994 model) and
18 interneurons (Traub 1995 model), developed and submitted to BABEL,
the GENESIS Users Group, by Kerstin Menne (Menne et al., 2002) It
contains papers and a thesis with detailed documentation of the model.

<P>
<A HREF="TurtleVisCortex/README.html">TurtleVisCortex/</A>
 - This is the Nenadic et al. (2003) large scale model of
turtle visual cortex.  It contains 368 lateral neurons, 311 medial neurons,
20 horizontal, 45 stellate neurons, and 44 subpial neurons in a simulated
1.6 x 1.6 mm piece of cortex.  There are also 201 LGN input neurons.
