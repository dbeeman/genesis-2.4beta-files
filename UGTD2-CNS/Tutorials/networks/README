This directory contains the documented GENESIS network simulations:

RSnet/ - RSnet is a demonstration of a simple network, consisting of a grid
    of simplified neocortical regular spiking pyramidal cells, each one
    coupled with excitory synaptic connections to its four nearest
    neighbors.  It is described and analyzed in the GENESIS Modeling
    Tutorial section "Creating large networks with GENESIS".

synfirenet/ - Contains an example of a more abstract type of network
    connectivity, the synfire chain.  These scripts were developed by
    Dieter Jaeger as as an exercise in script programming of networks, and
    the scripts were designed to be easily modified.  The network model
    also allows Hebbian learning.  The main script is netsim.g.  The GUI
    lets you experiment with the model, and the HELP menu offers
    suggestions on ways to modify the model.  The README file explains
    about synfire chains and the details of this model.


Vogels-Abbott_net/  - Contains the GENESIS implementations of the
    Vogels and Abbott (2005) model using single compartment neurons
    with Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics.  This was used as a benchmark for neural
    simulators in the review by Brette et al.  (2007).
    The README file gives gives further details.

Additional networks for this extended version of the Tutorials package:

hippo2/ - This is a small hippocampal network model consisting of 72
    pyramidal cells (Traub 1994 model) and 18 interneurons (Traub 1995
    model), developed and submitted to BABEL, the GENESIS Users Group, by
    Kerstin Menne (Menne et al., 2002)  It contains detailed documentation.

TurtleVisCortex/ - This is the Nenadic et al. (2003) large scale model of
turtle visual cortex.  It contains 368 lateral neurons, 311 medial neurons,
20 horizontal, 45 stellate neurons, and 44 subpial neurons in a simulated
1.6 x 1.6 mm piece of cortex.  There are also 201 LGN input neurons.
