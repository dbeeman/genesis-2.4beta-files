<a name="cnslec2"><h1>Modeling More Complex Cells and Networks</h1></a>
<p>
The model neuron that we saw in the last simulation is an example of
what has been called the "platonic neuron".  It is an idealized
picture, in which the dendrites have synaptically activated channels
and the soma has voltage activated Na and K channels.  Excitatory PSPs
that originate in the dendrites propagate passively to the soma,
undergoing some attenuation.  If they are of sufficient magnitude when
they reach the soma, they can raise the membrane potential high enough
to initiate action potentials.  Many neurons fit this description, but
this is not always the case.  
<p>

<p>
The neuron firing patterns that we saw in the <a
href="cns2a.html#Neuron_tut">Neuron tutorial in the last lecture</a>
and the Squid tutorial in the <a href="cns1.html#HHmodel"> lecture on
the Hodgkin-Huxley model</a> fired with regularly spaced action potentials.
<a href="references.html#BoG_Chapt7">
BoG Chapter 7 (Bower and Beeman, 1998)</a> was assigned as reading for
this lecture.  It describes a variety of ionic conductances found in
neurons that differ from the "squid-like" Na and K conductances that
were used in these tutorials.  Figure 7.1 shows a variety of firing
patterns from molluscan neurons that include tonic firing, bursting,
and "chattering".

<p>
Current clamp experiments on neocortical pyramidal cells often show results
similar to this example of a GENESIS cortical pyramidal cell simulation:

<p>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><img src="adaptation.gif">

<p>
This shows a <i>spike latency</i> T<SUB>0</SUB>, and <i>spike
frequency adaption</i>, in which the interval between spikes increases
with the time that the neuron is stimulated with the current pulse.
It is believed that this might provide a mechanism for processing
behaviorally relevant stimuli.

<p>Now, I'd like to talk about simulations involving a cell that
doesn't fit this simple picture, and show some simulation results.
The Squid, Neuron, and Cable simulations that we have used so far were
written as educational tutorials, rather than as way to learn anything
that isn't already known about neural behavior.  The next two, as with
the Purkinje tutorial, were adapted from research simulations and
converted to GENESIS tutorials with the addition of some fancy
graphics and menus for modifying parameters.

<a name="traub91"><h2>The Traub Model Hippocampal Pyramidal Cell</h2></a>

<p>The first of these simulations is a model of a hippocampal pyramidal
cell, which was made by <a href="references.html#Traub91">
Traub, Wong, Miles and Michelson.</a>

<p>Let's take a look at a <a href="ca3small.gif">real pyramidal
cell</a> from the CA3 region of the hippocampus before we look at the
model.  This is the cell we used in the last lecture as an example of
something we might want to model.  Variations of this neuron are found
in the both the cortex and the hippocampus.  It has a pyramid-shaped
soma and two large dendritic trees, the apical dendrites at the top,
and the smaller basal dendrites at the bottom.  There is also a long
thin axon that you can't see here.  Obviously, all this extended
branching can allow for a lot of information processing of its many
inputs, by making use of both temporal and spatial summation.  Last
time, we learned that models that attempt to study this in detail have
might have hundreds of compartments.  On the other hand, there have
been simulations with only a few compartments, but large numbers of
cells, that do a good job of describing the properties of networks of
these cells in the hippocampus and the visual and olfactory cortex.

<p>Pyramidal cells in the hippocampus show a range of interesting firing
patterns.  With no external input, a cell fires bursts of action potentials
every few seconds.  With increasing amounts of stimulation, the frequency of
bursts increases.  With even larger amounts of input, the cell switches over
to a pattern of regular firing instead of bursting.  During an epileptic
seizure, the bursts in different cells become synchronized over large
portions of the hippocampus.  So, there are lots of good reasons for wanting
to understand more about the behavior of these cells.  In fact, this
model was constructed for use in a network model of a portion of the
hippocampus in order to study causes of this synchronized firing.

<p>In many cells, the voltage activated channels are concentrated near the
base of the soma in the region called the "axon hillock" near the axon.  The
channels in the dendrites tend to be synaptically activated channels.  It
turns out that pyramidal cells have voltage activated channels in the
dendrites as well, and these seem to have a lot to do with the bursting
patterns.

<p>The soma and its nearby compartments contain voltage activated Na and
K channels that are somewhat like the ones that Hodgkin and Huxley
studied in the squid axon.  However, the interesting behavior of this
cell arises from at least four other kinds of ion channels that are
known to exist in pyramidal cells.  Data from voltage clamp
experiments was used to model the dynamics of these channels and to
make reasonable hypotheses about their distribution throughout the
cell.  Once we have verified that the model can reproduce experimental
results, we can use the simulation to understand the ways in which the
various channels interact and produce distinctive bursting patterns of
action potentials.

<p>Calcium channels turn out to be particularly important.  These are spread
throughout the cell, but are most concentrated in the middle and
distal dendrites.  Ca has a high equilibrium potential, so Ca ions can
travel inward and can produce action potentials like Na.  However the
Ca conductance only becomes activated at high voltages, so it needs to
be triggered by Na action potentials.  There is also a much larger
time constant for inactivation, on the order of 200 msec.

<p>Not only do Ca channels have a direct effect on the membrane potential, but
they have an indirect effect as well. There are two types of K channels whose
activation depends on the concentration of Ca in the cell.  The potassium
C-current is fast and depends on both Ca concentration and voltage; The AHP
(after hyperpolarization) current is slow and depends only on Ca
concentration.  The transient A current is an inactivating potassium current
that depends only on V. It affects the interval and onset of action
potentials, but has a relatively small effect in this model.

<p>To summarize, we have the following conductances:

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<p><b>Na</b> - fast, depolarizing
<p><b>K</b> - slower, non-inactivating, hyperpolarizing
<p><b>Ca</b> - high threshold, inactivates slowly, depolarizing
<p><b>C</b> - K conductance that depends on [Ca] and V, fast, hyperpolarizing
<p><b>AHP</b> - K conductance that depends on [Ca], slow, hyperpolarizing
<p><b>A</b> - K conductance that depends on V, inactivates, hyperpolarizing
</FONT>

<p>We will see that there is an interesting interplay between these
different channels.

<h2>Traub Pyramidal Cell Model - Bursting Behavior</h2>

<p>This simplified model has 19 compartments with a soma in the center and
two linear chains of compartments to represent the apical dendrites (fat)
and the basal dendrites (thin).

<p>Let's run the simulation and see what we can discover.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="traub.gif" WIDTH=888 HEIGHT=718>

<p>I've already planted recording electrodes in the soma and at a
point midway along the apical dendrite where there is a high
concentration of Ca channels.  The control panel at the left
allows us to perform different experiments on the cell, ranging from
current and voltage clamp experiments to various ways of stimulating
synaptically activated channels.  We'll chose a current clamp
experiment with an injection current of 0.3 nA.
We'll plant an injection electrode in the soma.

<p>In this static web version of the simulation, we are showing a composite image of
the simulation results.  The two windows at the LEFT, show a point part way
through the simulation.  The windows at the RIGHT will be described a bit
further on.

<p>If you can view quicktime movies (and have a fast enough connection), you can
<a href="traub91.mov">watch this movie of the simulation.</a>

<p>We can see some interesting bursts of color which represent the membrane
potential in the various compartments.  Although it happens pretty fast, you
might notice that the "hot" colors correspond to peaks in the potential
which are plotted below.  Let's try to make some sense
out of this plot.  The lower one shows a burst of action potentials in
the soma which terminates after about 50 msec.  If we were to run the
simulation longer, we would see another burst in about a second.  The curve
above, which has been displaced by 100 mV for clarity, shows what's
happening out in the apical dendrite.  Here the spike is very broad and
somewhat delayed.  There aren't any Na channels in this region, but the
density of Ca channels is high, so we might suspect that we are seeing a Ca
action potential on top of whatever soma potential that has propagated to
this point.

<p>We wonder what this might have to do with the termination of the burst
of action potentials.

<h3>The calcium conductance</h3>

<p>As we are interested in the Ca channels, I've brought up another window,
which will let us plot the Ca conductance at the two points. (This is shown
at the LOWER RIGHT, for the complete simulation run. The plot above it
shows the membrane potential for the entire 100 msec run.)

we are interested in the Ca channels, I've brought up another
window, which will let us plot the Ca conductance at the two
points. (This is shown at the LOWER LEFT, for the complete simulation
run.  The plot above it shows the membrane potential for the entire
run.)

<p><a href="traub.gif">Click here to see the previous figure again</a>

<p>Watch the propagation of the action potential in the soma along the
dendrite.  Now, we are starting to see something happening near our
probe in the apical dendrite.  As we get to the peak in V<sub>m</sub> in
the middle of the apical dendrite we see a hot yellow spot in this region
where the membrane potential is high.  There aren't any Na channels
here, so this must be coming from Ca ions.
Our hypothesis is that, when the action potential propagates
to the dendrite, it raises the membrane potential.  We can see a bump
corresponding to the first one.  By the time the second one arrives, it has
raised the mebrane potential high enough to activate the high threshold Ca
channels.  This produces a broad action potential in the dendrite.
(This is another example of temporal summation.)

<p>As we continue stepping the simulation, we see several
spikes about 5 msec or less apart.  Evidently the broad
Ca peak is keeping the cell depolarized to allow Na spiking while the
Ca-dependent K channels are trying to repolarize it and stop the Na
spikes.  The K conductances build up as calcium enters the cell, and
they eventually win.

<p>The plot of Ca conductance below confirms this suspicion.
There is a huge broad peak in the Ca conductance in the dendrite
corresponding to the voltage peak.  There is a tiny blip showing the
Ca conductance in the soma.  The Ca channel density in the soma is
fairly low, so we aren't seeing much conductance.

<p><a href="traub.gif">Click here to see the figure one more time</a>

<h3>Removal of Ca conductance</h3>

<p>We can test this hypothesis by setting the density of selected
channels to zero.  This simulation lets us use the mouse to select
various compartments and channels for editing.  I'll set the maximum
Ca conductance to zero for all the compartments and then we'll run the
simulation again.

<p>Now we have all the Calcium channels in the cell disabled.  So not only will
there be no Ca conductance, but we won't have any of the K currents which
depend on Ca concentration.  What differences can we see?

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="traubnoCa.gif" WIDTH=762 HEIGHT=338>

<p>For one thing, the spike interval is larger, around 20 msec, because we
don't have the Ca channels adding to the depolarization.  Also, there is
continuous regular firing instead of bursts.  Although we haven't directly
shown this here, it is because the calcium concentration dependent K channels
aren't being activated.

<p>You may have also noticed that the spread of activation into the dendrites
is passive.  Looking at the colors we can see that the membrane potential is
highest near the soma, with no flashes of "hot spots" in the dendrites.  It
looks like the "platonic neuron" with no action potentials ocurring in the
dendrites.

<p>
<a href="traub91blocked.mov">Here is a quicktime movie</a>
of the simulation, with the calcium channels blocked.

<a name="piriform"><h2>The Piriform Cortex Simulation</h2></a>

<p>Now, I'd like to talk about something else that involves pyramidal cells.
Pyramidal cells occur not just in the hippocampus, but also in the cortex.
They make a major contribution to the way that information is processed in
cortical areas.

<p>A lot of studies of the visual cortex have been made, but we will look
at the olfactory cortex.  This is a rather interesting area of the
brain.  Although it has rich and complex behavior, it doesn't have as
many levels of processing as occur in the visual cortex.  When you
study the visual cortex, you will learn that there are a lot of levels
of feature extraction that occur in the various layers of the visual
cortex.

<p>There is also some pretty sophisticated processing of different odors in the
olfactory cortex.  We'd like to understand how a rat can distinguish what is
good to eat from what isn't.

<p>The circuitry is a little simpler here.  We get some input from the
olfactory receptors to a region known as the olfactory bulb, where
some processing goes on, then it goes along what is called the Lateral
Olfactory Tract (LOT) to the olfactory cortex, also called the
piriform cortex.

<p align=center><img src="lot.gif" WIDTH=473 HEIGHT=164>

<p>Fibers come from the front (rostral) and extend toward the rear
(caudal).  Axons go across the sheet of cortex to connect to the
pyramidal cells.  There are many more connections at the front, than
at the rear, so the input from the LOT is greater at the rostral end.


<p>Here is a wiring diagram:

<p align=center><img src="wiringB.gif" WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=209>

<p>This diagram shows the several different kinds of connections to the
pyramidal cells. The pyramidal cells extend downward through this
layer of cortex, aligned perpendicular to the surface.

<p>At the top, on the apical dendrites, we get connections from the olfactory
bulb via the LOT providing the external input to the piriform cortex.

<p>There are also a lot of connections between the pyramidal cells.

<p>The <b>rostrally directed association fibers</b> go forward and meet other
cells close to the soma (excitatory inputs).

<p>There are <b>caudally directed association fibers</b> which go to the
rear and hit the upper middle part of the apical dendrites, also
making excitatory inputs.

<p>There are also some <b>local association fibers</b> that go to very
nearby cells in both directions and connect to the basal dendrites.

<p>All of the above connections are excitatory.


<p>And, if that weren't enough, there are also a number of inhibitory
connections which are formed via interneurons.  These are small neurons that
take an excitatory input and release a neurotransmitter that causes an
inhibition on the target pyramidal cell.  We have two kinds, and they have
different time constants for activation and decay of the channel conductance.

<p align=center><img src="wiringC.gif" WIDTH=523 HEIGHT=165>

<dl>
<dt><b>feedforward interneurons</b>
<dd>make connections at the top (primarily from the LOT) - slow dynamics

<dt><b>feedback interneurons</b>
<dd>connect near the soma (primarily from local pyramidal cells) - fast dynamics
</dl>

<p>The point of the modeling is to understand how this variety of synaptic
connections influences the behavior of the network.  The big picture is to
understand how the piriform cortex recognizes odors.

<p>Another important motivation is to understand the origin of the 40 hz
oscillations seen in the EEG recordings.  These are recordings from
the scalp, and are recording potentials that arise from very large
populations of neurons.  It isn't very selective - we get coarse
mapping of neural activity, and find bursts of 40 Hz osccillations
(the gamma waves) coming at about 7-10 Hz (the theta waves).

<p>These oscillations been known to exist in the olfactory cortex for a long
time.  More recently they caused quite a stir when people have discovered
that they occur in the visual cortex.

<p>There has been a lot of speculation about their origin and purpose.
They have been thought by some to possibly be ways to carry information.
They have even been ascribed to having something to do with
consciousness or the so-called binding problem in psychology.  If you
have neurons that fire when you recognize something red, and others
that fire when you recognize a ball, how do you put them together to
recognize a red ball?  Perhaps this arises when the firings of these
neurons is coordinated in some way, and we see coherent oscillations.

<p>The result of this simulation suggests something maybe not quite so
exciting.  It seems that they are an epiphenomenon; just an intrinsic
property of the network, and arise as a byproduct of the other
processing which is going on.  In fact, the simulation showed that these
oscillations are generated even with random input.

<p><a href="references.html#WilsonBower1992">
Wilson and Bower</a> did a GENESIS simulation of the olfactory cortex a
few years ago, and modeled a network of these cells using a simple five
compartment model for the pyramidal cell, with a compartment
corresponding to each of the layers receiving input.  They used 1500
of each of the pyramidal cells and the two types of interneurons.  The
interneurons use a single compartment, as they have very little
dendritic structure.

<p align=center><img src="net_circuit.gif" WIDTH=402 HEIGHT=499>

<p>I'd like to tell you about a tutorial version of the Wilson-Bower
simulation, which was created by
<a href="references.html#Protopapas1998">Alex Protopapas</a>
at Caltech.  This is a scaled down model, with 135 of each of these three
kinds of neurons, arranged in a 9 x 15 grid.

<p>As there is a lot to see on the screen of the simulation, I'll first show
you a static picture of it.

<p align=center><img src="pir2colo.gif" WIDTH=1103 HEIGHT=531>

<p>At the left, there is another picture of the cell connection diagram.
But it's an interactive picture, in the simulation, you can click on
the various synapses and bring up menus to change various things like
the time constants.  (red = excitatory; blue = inhibitory)

<p>We can also click on things to determine what you want to plot.
Some of the interesting things to plot are:

<p><b>The simulated EEG recording (center plot)</b>  - it averages the
extracellular potential from many of these neurons.  If you look at
the time scale, you can see that oscillations are coming at about 40
Hz.  This has been observed in EEG recordings from rats, while
sniffing odors and, when subjected to somewhat unkind things, like
electric shocks to the LOT, in order to provide a strong random input.

<p><b>plot of columns</b> - this is one row in the 9 x 15 array of neurons, seen
from the side (135 of each kind) we are looking at 15 pyramidal cells
from top to bottom.  We are seeing the membrane potential in each of
the 5 compartments.  In this one we can see that some of these are
firing some APs (hot colors = high V<sub>m</sub>).

<p>The <b>bottom plot</b> is probably the most interesting, and certainly the
prettiest - here is a view of the entire network, but it is a
horizontal slice which is taken at the point right here, the Superior
1b layer - it is receiving inputs from other pyramidal cells that are
at the forward end.  Different colors represent the amount of
activation of these synapses.  In the real time display, you will see
these waves propagating from front to rear - at what frequency?  40 Hz,
corresponding to what goes on in the EEG pattern.  We can see these
yellow bands of activation propagating across the network.

<p>Since the propagation of these waves of activation is one of the important
results of the simulation, let's take another look at the
cross-sectional view of the network of pyramidal cells.

<p><img src="pirview.gif" WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=191> <img src="pireeg.gif" WIDTH=461 HEIGHT=194> 

<p>Here we're seeing the wave of oscillations in the activation of channels
in the Superior 1b layer and the simulated EEG pattern.

<p>Although the simulated input along the LOT is random, the network
(which uses axonal propagation velocities and channel time constants
from experimental measurements) still generates the oscillations that
are seen when recording from an awake behaving animal.

<p>The peak in the EEG at about every 25 msec is the 40 Hz gamma rhythm,
occurring in bursts at the theta frequency of 7-10 Hz.
The cause appears to be these feedback interneurons.  If you play with
the simulation and change the time constants of these, the 40 Hz
oscilations go away.

<p>It seems to be a result of the way that the network is designed, and
as a byproduct of the information processing which is ocurring, the
inhibitory interneurons suppress the pyramidal cells for periods of
about 25 msec at a time, resulting in 40 Hz oscillations in their
ability to activate.  These results suggest that this natural tendency to
oscillate at this frequency might be required for odor recognition, so that
different synaptic inputs will arrive at particular times with respect to
others.

<H2>The Nenadic, Ghosh, and Ulinski turtle visual cortex model</H2>

<P>
Extracellular recordings and the use of voltage-sensitive dyes have
revealed that novel visual stimuli produce waves of activity in the visual
cortex of freshwater turtles.  It has been suggested that the dynamics of
these waves contain information about the position and speed of stimuli in
visual space.

<P>
The Nenadic, Ghosh, and Ulinski (2003) large scale model of turtle visual
cortex is based on the known anatomy and physiology of the varieties of
neurons found in the visual cortex.  It is being used to study the cortical
activation when different types of moving or stationary stimuli are
presented to the retina.  The model has been used to show that the
stimulation of spots of light presented at different points along the
horizontal meridian produce different phase space trajectories of the
waves.  This could be used to locate the position of the spot of light,
although there is presently no evidence that this information is used by
the turtle in visual tasks.

<P>
The turtle visual cortex consists of the three layers of cells, with the
middle layer containing pyramidal cells, and the other two containing a
variety of interneurons.  The model has a total of 918 neurons that consist
of 3 to 16 compartments.

<P>
The lateral and medial pyramidal cells have different sizes
and characteristics, so the model represents them as 368 lateral neurons
(shown as squares in the simulation) and 311 medial neurons (shown as
triangles). There are also 20 horizontal, 45 stellate neurons, and 44
subpial neurons in a simulated 1.6 x 1.6 mm piece of cortex.  The network
receives its input from the retina via 201 LGN neurons.

<P>
The pattern of excitatory synaptic connections from the LGN were based on
experimental measurements and are to lateral and medial pyramidal cells and
stellate cells.  They are most dense at the rostro-lateral end of the
cortex (lower right in the network view below), where the cortical wave
begins.

<P>
The default stimulus applied is the "diffuse light flash", simulated with a
0.15 sec pulse of 0.2 nA injection current to the soma of all 201 LGN
neurons.  The simulation also allows stimulation of subsets of the LGN
neurons to produce a stationary light spot or a moving light spot.  It is
also possible to provide direct stimulation to a population of of neurons
(e.g. lateral cells) in a specified rectangular or circular area.

<p align=center><img src="NGUgrab.gif">

<P>
The four graphs show the network response by plotting the soma membrane
potential of the medial and lateral layer pyramidal cell neurons
/network_lateral/cell321, /network_medial/cell279, /network_lateral/cell1,
and /network_medial/cell1.  The window under the control panel shows the
locations of the lateral (represented by squares) and medial (represented
by triangles) pyramidal cells.  During the simulation, they change color to
represent the soma membrane potenial of the cells cells.  This snapshot was
taken at about 0.4 sec when the wave shows maximal excitation at both the
upper left and lower left.

<P><A HREF="NGU5.wmv">See a video clip of the simulation (MS WMV format)</A>

<P>
For the first 0.6 seconds of the simulation, you will see the spreading
wave of activation, beginning at the rostro-lateral end of the cortex about
15 msec after the flash.  It propagates across the cortex and begins to die
out after 600 msec.  If the simulation in the video had continued longer,

<P>
The simulation scripts and documentation for the model are included in the
"Ultimate GENESIS Tutorial Distribution" package from the the GENESIS web
site, and also my be downloaded from ModelDB
(<A HREF="http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=94845">

<p>I hope these examples have given you some feel for how computer
simulation can be a powerful and useful tool for understanding how the
brain processes information.
