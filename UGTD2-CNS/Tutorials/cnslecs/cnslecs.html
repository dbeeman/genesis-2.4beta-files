<H1><img src="weblec.gif" align="middle">Lectures on Computational Neuroscience</H1>

<P> This web version of some introductory lectures on computational
neuroscience and biologically realistic neural modeling are derived from
lecture notes for an introductory biomedical engineering course at the
University of Colorado.  The course, <a
href="http://ece.colorado.edu/~ecen4831/">Brains, Minds, and Computers</a>
is a survey of introductory concepts in neuroscience, neural modeling, and
artificial neural networks, for upper division undergraduate and graduate
students in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  The lectures show example
simulations performed with the <a
href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/">GENESIS simulator</a>, but are
general in nature, and don't require any knowledge of GENESIS.

<P> In these three 70 minute lectures, I used slides and video clips of tutorial
simulations performed with the simulator, which I've replaced with still
images and some short video clips in the web version.  Students will get
the most out of these lectures if they have had a basic introduction to
neuron membrane properties and signaling in an introductory neuroscience
text similar to the ones in <a href="references.html#texts">this list</a>.
Of course, it is even better if it is possible for the students to
interactively run the tutorials themselves.  Detailed instructions for
using the tutorials are contained within the GENESIS distribution and in <a
href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/bog/bog.html">The Book of GENESIS:
Exploring Realistic Neural Models with the GEneral NEural SImulation
System.</a>
