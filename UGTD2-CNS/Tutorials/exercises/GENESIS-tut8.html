<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Channel modeling, Traub model, and Neurokit</A></H1>

<P>
This set of exercises was used at the Latin American School on
Computational Neuroscience (LASCON) to get students to the point
of quickly creating cell models.

Pick an intresting neuron for which (ideally):

<UL>
  <LI>There is no GENESIS model
  <LI>Important channels have been identified
  <LI>Some voltage clamp data is available
  <LI>Some current clamp data is available

</UL>

<UL>
  <LI>Make simplifed morphology ("ball and stick" or "reduced morpholgy")
  <LI>Implement channels

    <LI>starting from scratch, or
    <LI>modifying existing GENESIS channels (Scripts/neurokit/prototypes
