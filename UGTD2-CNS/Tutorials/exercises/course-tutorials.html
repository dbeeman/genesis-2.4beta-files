<H3>Introduction to GENESIS - an overview of GENESIS</H3>
<P>

A series of GENESIS tutorials typically begins with a presentation that gives an
overview of realistic neural modeling in general, followed by another that shows
how the GENESIS simulator is used to implement these modeling paradigms.  The
tutorial
<A HREF="../genesis-intro/genesis-intro.html">Introduction to Realistic Neural
Modeling with GENESIS</A> is based on similar talks at past neural modeling courses.

<P>
<H3>GENESIS Tutorial 1 - Hands-on use of GENESIS</H3>

<P>
<OL>

<P>
<LI>Take a quick look at the first two parts of the
<A HREF="../genprog/index.html">GENESIS Modeling Tutorial</A>.
<P>
<LI>Run "genesis" in a console window and work through 
<A HREF="../genprog/tutorial1.html">A basic tutorial on GENESIS</A>.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>GENESIS Tutorial 2 - Single cell modeling</H3>
<P>
<OL>

<LI>Work through <A HREF="../genprog/simplecell-tut.html">
Building a cell the easy way</A> and modify your own copy of simplecell.g
to make a more interesting cell.  If you have time, do some of the exercises in
<A HREF="Gtutorial2.html">Gtutorial2.html</A>.

</OL>
<P>
<P>
<H3>GENESIS Tutorial 3 - Modeling neural circuits and small networks</H3>
<P>

Study <A HREF="../genprog/synchan-tut.html">Making synaptic
connections</A> and connect two cells in an excitatory/inhibitory
network.  The exercise statement and initial scripts to modify are
in <A HREF="simple-network/README.html">
Tutorials/exercises/simple-network</A>.
<P>

<H3>GENESIS Tutorial 4 - Modeling large cortical networks</H3>
<P>

<OL>
 
<LI>Study enough of the <A HREF="../genprog/index.html">
Modeling Tutorial</A> to understand  <A HREF="../genprog/net-tut.html">
Creating large networks with GENESIS</A>, and the example scripts
in <i>Tutorials/networks/RSnet</i>.

<P>
<LI>Final goal: Modify the RSnet example to create a network of your own
design. Some suggestions are at the end of the networks section, and in
"Getting Started With Realistic Neural Modeling".
</OL>
<P>

<B>Project suggestions</B>

<P>The <A HREF="../networks/index.html"> Tutorials/networks</A>
directory contains several network models that could be used as a
starting point for new simulations.

<P>
Study the documentation and scripts for the
<A HREF="../networks/ACnet2-GENESIS/README.html">ACnet2</A> auditory
cortex model.  The tutorial for the model lists several 'Experiments to try'.
There are a large number of parameter variations that can be made
to modify the behavior of this model. Most of these can be
accomplished either through the GUI or with simple changes to option
strings in the scripts.

<P>
Change the cells, connection algorithm, or the input model to
represent a different cortical area.  There are many cell models to
choose from in the Tutorials/cells directory.
<P>
Develop an alternate input model to provide stimuli typical of that
produced by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). This can be done
using a 'script_out' object to provide the stimulus at clocked intervals.
The procedure is illustrated with a simulation of effects of fMRI fields
available at <A HREF="http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/fMRInet">
http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/fMRInet</A>.
<P>
NEURON users who want to compare the two simulators may want to try
converting the ACnet2 model to NEURON and comparing the performance.
<P>
The Open Source Brain page for the
<A HREF="http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/acnet2">Primary Auditory
Cortex network</A> has links for initial conversions of the model cells
to neuroContruct and NeuroML.  This would be a good starting point for
learning how to to convert models between simulators.
<P>

The Open Source Brain page for
the <A HREF="http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/thalamocortical">
Traub et al. (2005) Thalamocortical network</A> has the single cell
models implemented in NeuroML, NEURON, GENESIS, and MOOSE.  These
models could be used for either a simplified or full implemention of
this popular model in GENESIS.

<P>
The documentation for the
<A HREF="../networks/VAnet2/README.html"> VAnet2 model</A>
describes this efficient hsolved GENESIS version of the Vogels and
Abbott (2005) model.  It serves as a tutorial on the use of hsolve to
achieve at least a factor of 10 speedup, in the context of a very
simple model.  The 'VAnet2-batch.g' script is intended to be extended
for testing GENESIS spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
implementations with hsolve. This script would be a good starting
point for models that use more realistic cells and connections.
<P>

<H3>GENESIS Tutorial 5 - Using hsolve; synaptic plasticity</H3>
<P>
<B>For background:</B>

<OL>
<LI>Read BoG Chapter 20  - Last part: using hsolve
<LI>Read BoG Chapter 15  - Section 15.4 - Learning and Synaptic Plasticity
<LI>Look at the scripts and demos in <I>genesis/Scripts/examples</I> for
   <I>facsynchan</I> and <I>hebb</I> (the hebbsynchan).
<LI>Study the demonstration scripts for the <I>stdp_rules</I> object
in <I>genesis/Scripts/stdp_rules</I>, and the documentation on
<A HREF="../Hyperdoc/NewPlasticityObjects.html"> New Plasticity Objects</A>.
This describes a new GENESIS 2.4 object that allows spike timing
dependent plasticity rules to be applied to synchan elements in a
way that is compatible with hsolve.

<LI>For more details on the use of <I>hsolve</I>, see the 
documentation for the <A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual-26.html#ss26.34">
hsolve object</A> and the advanced tutorial
<A HREF="../advanced-tutorials/hsolve-cornelis/index.html">
Simulations with GENESIS using hsolve</A>.

<LI>Also see the exercise <A HREF="Gtut5.html">Gtut5.html</A>.
</OL>

<P>
<B>After studying the ACnet2 or VAnet2 documentation and scripts</B>
<P>
Make an  hsolveable version of RScell and then of RSnet.
Do some execution time comparisons with and without hsolve.

<P>
Modify RSnet to send Vm data and the Ex_channel Ik current
to data files that may be visualized with python-tools/netview.py
<P>
The numerical calculations for the cells will be slightly more accurate
when hsolve is used, and sequence of action potentials will be similar,
but slightly different.  How will you determine if your hsolved version
of RSnet is producing the "correct" results?
<P>
<B>Possible projects:</B>
<P>
Create an efficient hsolved two-population cortical network model
based on either VAnet2 or ACnet2, using different cells.  Consider
a different connection algorithm and different input models.

<P>
Implement the Song, Miller, and Abbott (2000) algorithm for spike
timing dependent plasticity (STDP) for the VAnet2 model using the
<I>stdp_rules</I> object. There are further suggestions in the ACnet2
documentation under "Experiments to try" and at end of
the <A HREF="../networks/VAnet2/README.html">README file for
VAnet2</A>.
