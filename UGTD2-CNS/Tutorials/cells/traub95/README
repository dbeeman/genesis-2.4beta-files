This is a version of Traub's 51-compartment hippocampal interneuron,
contributed by Eliot Menschik.  This, and the traub94 model pyramidal
cell are described in the papers:

Menschik, E. D. and Finkel, L. H. (1998) Neuromodulatory control of
hippocampal function: Towards a model of Alzheimer's disease. Artificial
Intelligence in Medicine 13:99-121.

Menschik, E.D. and Finkel, L.H. (1999) Cholinergic neuromodulation and
Alzheimer's disease: from single cells to network simulations. Progress in
Brain Research, 121:19-45.

The files are:

traub95.p - the cell parameter file
protodefs_traub95.g - file containing the channel definitions

Note, this cell, like the Traub94 cell still suffers from the fact
that the K_C current depends on using the vdep_object which is not
supported by hsolve in other than chanmodes 0 and 1.  Ideally, the
implementation of this current should be modified to use the GENESIS
2.2 tabchannel "instant" field as was done in
genesis/Scripts/traub91/traub91proto.g.

If you carry out this relatively simple modification (which will speed up
the simulation), please contribute it to BABEL.
