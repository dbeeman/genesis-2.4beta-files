<H1>Some suggestions for installing Linux on a PC</H1>
<P>


<P>
This is an outline of what you need to do to install Linux, and some sources
of information to help you.
For detailed information about Linux, see the web site for The Linux
Documentation Project, <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</A>.


<A NAME="section-1"><H2>Prepare a place for Linux on your hard drive</H2></A>

<P>
If you have a desktop computer, the easiest solution is to add another disk
drive to devote to Linux, rather than sharing the existing drive with
Windows.  This minimizes the chances of making a mistake that will mess up
your Windows disk.  Buy whatever hard drive your local office supply or
computer store has on sale for less than $100, and you will have plenty of
disk space for a Linux installation.  Installing it in your computer will be
straightforward, following the instructions that come with the drive.

<P> If you have a laptop, or you would rather wrestle with software than
hardware, you can install Linux on the same drive that holds Windows.
Initially, the entire disk will be formatted as a Windows file system, or
there may be other partitions for backup and system files.  You will need
to shrink the Windows partition to make room for a Linux partition and a
Linux swap partition.  This may be done with the free utility QTParted (a
clone of the commercial program Partition Magic).  It may be found at
http://qtparted.sourceforge.net/.  It may also be included in some
Linux distributions.  The Knoppix Live Linux CD, which can be obtained
http://www.knoppix.net/, contains QTParted, and allows you to boot a version
of Debian Linux without making any changes to your hard drive.  This is
useful for trying out Linux and setting up your drive before installing
Linux.

<A NAME="section-2"><H2>Get a Linux distribution</H2></A>

<P> There are several choices of Linux distributions, and they are all
quite similar in terms of what they provide.  Red Hat Fedora Linux
(http://www.redhat.com/fedora) is one of the most popular.  
Ubuntu Linux (http://www.ubuntu.com/) and its variations such as Kbuntu
(which uses the KDE desktop) is another popular distrubution.  SuSE Linux
(http://www.novell.com/linux/) is also very highly regarded, as is Gentoo
Linux (http://www.gentoo.org/).  All of these are available for free
download from their web sites, along with the necessary documentation.
But, if you are new to Linux, it may be best to buy a Linux distribution
set with CDROMs, an installation manual, and an introduction to using
Linux.  You will find many choices at a bookstore or computer store.

<A NAME="section-3"><H1>Decide on a partitioning scheme</H1></A>

<P> The instructions for installing whatever Linux distribution you choose
will require you to understand somthing about disk partitioning and the unix
device names for disk partions. For example, the primary master drive on a PC
is called <i>/dev/hda</i>, and the primary slave <i>/dev/hdb</i>.  The Windows
"C:" drive is normally the first and only partion on <i>/dev/hda</i>, and is
called <i>/dev/hda1</i>.  You will need to select which other partitions on
which drives you will devote to Linux and to the swap partition.  A mistake at
this point could ruin your Windows installation, so you should read these
instructions carefully.

<A NAME="section-4"><H2>Finallly</H2></A>

<P> Install Linux following the instructions that came with the
distribution package.  These will include instructions for setting up the
computer to give you a choice of whether to boot Windows or Linux.  Be sure
to install the various programming tools and development libraries, which
are not always installed by default in a minimal installation.  Start Linux
and then use a browser to read any provided HTML documentation for using
Linux.  You will find lots of help at the The Linux Documentation Project,
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</A>, and a short guide
on this CDROM in <A HREF="unixhelp.html">Introduction to
UNIX or Linux and the graphical desktop</A>.

<P>Then, install GENESIS and start playing with the tutorials and
demonstration scripts!
