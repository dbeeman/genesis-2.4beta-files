<P>Elements are the basic computing and organizational entities available
to the user.  Elements are organized in a hierarchical structure similar
to a UNIX directory tree.  Each element embodies a specific computation
in the simulation.  This computation may implement part of the model being
simulated or may be part of the graphical interface or file I/O.</P>
<P>The state of an element is contained in the element's fields.  Fields may
be of any C defined type.  A field protection facility provides for both
the visibility and accessability of the element fields.  Fields have default
values which define the state of an element's fields when the element is
created.  The default values may be changed, changing the initial values of
elements created subsequently.</P>
<P>Elements may need information from other elements to perform their
calculations.  This information is gathered from the other elements'
fields via 
<A HREF="Manual-13.html#Messages">Messages</A>.</P>
<P>A set of default element types (called ``objects'') is distributed
with GENESIS.  These are used as templates for the creation of the
particular elements that are used in a GENESIS simulation.  One
example of an element type is the ``compartment'' object, which is
used to create sections of neural membrane in a cell model.  Another
example is an ``xform'' object used to create graphical form widgets
which might appear on the screen.  The GENESIS distribution currently
contains about 120 predefined objects.  These are summarized in 
<A HREF="Manual-10.html#Objects">Objects</A>.</P>

<P>Other commands related to GENESIS elements are described in the
sections on 
<A HREF="Manual-9.html#Tree">Hierarchical Structure</A>, 
<A HREF="Manual-10.html#Objects">Objects</A>, and 
<A HREF="Manual-11.html#Extended">Extended Objects</A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="Actions"></A> <A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Actions</A></H2>

<P>Each element in a simulation is capable of performing one or more
actions.  An action can be described as an operation that an element
performs on its data.  The predefined actions of an element are inherited
from the object that was used to create the element.  Actions are defined
within compiled functions that are attached to each object.  Other actions
may be added with the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#addaction">addaction </a> command.</P>
<P>GENESIS calls many actions implicitly as part of the process of running a
simulation, or as a side effect of certain commands.  This allows
particular object-specific behaviors to executed at particular points in
simulation.  For example, the PROCESS action is called at each step of the
simulation.  Other actions are not performed regularly in the simulation
schedule, but are performed globally on all objects; these include the
CHECK action and the RESET action, which are invoked using the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#check">check </a> and 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#reset">reset </a> commands, respectively.  If a particular
action is not defined for an element, a default behavior is performed on
the element (SET sets the field, SHOW returns the field, CREATE leaves
fields initialized from defaults, etc.).</P>
<P>The following predefined actions are common to many GENESIS objects.</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
PROCESS </TD><TD> Called on each simulation step as described by the simulation</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> schedule to perform the element's update processing.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
INIT </TD><TD> Called on each simulation step as described by the simulation</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> schedule to initialize the element for this simulation step.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
RESET </TD><TD> Called when the simulation is reset (reset command) to allow</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> an element to reset itself to its default state.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
CHECK </TD><TD> Called from the check command to allow an element to verify</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> that it has all the information and the correct information</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> needed to proceed with the simulation.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
SET </TD><TD> Called when an element field is set (or once for a setfield</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> command if SPECIAL_SET exists as an element field). The SET</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> action must return 1 if it sets the field in question and 0</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> if it doesn't.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
SHOW </TD><TD> Called in order to perform special formating for field display</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> or retrieval (getfield or showfield commands).</TD></TR><TR><TD>
CREATE </TD><TD> Called when an element is created to initialize the element.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> Must return non zero if the initialization is successful.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
COPY </TD><TD> Called when an element is copied.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
DELETE </TD><TD> Called when an element is destroyed.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
SAVE2 </TD><TD> Called by save command to save state of the element to a file.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
RESTORE2 </TD><TD> Called by restore to restore previous state from a file.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
DUMP </TD><TD> Called by the simdump command.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
UNDUMP </TD><TD> Called by the simundump command.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</P>
<P>There are also a number of actions that have to be explicitly invoked on an
element-by-element basis, such as the TABCREATE action.  You invoke these
with the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#call">call </a> command, e.g.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
    call Na_tabchannel TABCREATE X 49 -0.1 0.05
</PRE>

This use of actions corresponds to the use of ``method calls'' in
object-oriented languages such as Java.</P>
<P>There are also situations where you may want to explictly call an action
(like RESET) for a particular element, without performing it on all
elements (e.g. by issuing a reset command).  This is because the the reset
routine gives no control over the order in which the elements are RESET,
and you may need to call the RESET action for specific elements in the
proper order if the initial state of one element depends on the initial
state of another element.  For example:
<PRE>
    call Ca RESET     // Reset the Ca channel
    call conc RESET   // Reset the Ca_concen element next
    reset             // reset everything
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Other predefined actions that are specific to the way the object is used are
described in the documentation for the particular object.  For a
description of actions that are specific to XODUS elements (widgets), see
<A HREF="Manual-20.html#Clicks">XODUS Mouse Clicks</A>.  A list of actions that an
object can perform can also be displayed using the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#showobject">showobject </a> command.</P>
