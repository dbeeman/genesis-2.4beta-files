<P> This is the reference manual for GENESIS version 2.4.  As there will be
continuing updates and additions to the manual, please be sure that you have
the most recent version.  Information about the latest version of GENESIS and
its documentation may be found on the GENESIS WWW site,
<A HREF="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">
http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/</A>.

<P>The help files in the on-line version (in the <EM>genesis/Docs</EM>
directory) may be viewed with the GENESIS command "<CODE>help topic |
more</CODE>", where "topic" is the name of a file with the extension
".txt".  As they are ASCII files, they may also be printed.  In
order to view the documentation in these help files in the
recommended order, type ``<CODE>help CONTENTS | more</CODE>'', or print out
the file ``CONTENTS.txt''.</P>
<P>Beginning with GENESIS 2.0.2, we have also incorporated these files
into a hypertext documentation system, which may be viewed with a web
browser.  The HTML hypertext documentation for
GENESIS is in a separate directory, <EM>genesis/Hyperdoc</EM>.  The main file
is "Manual.html", and there is a README file giving further information.</P>

<P>Some of the new features in GENESIS 2 are not yet documented here.
You may find a brief summary of these and the significant differences
from previous versions of GENESIS under 
<A HREF="Manual-2.html#Changes">Changes</A>.  
If there is no documentation for a particular GENESIS command, give
the name of the command followed by ``<CODE>-usage</CODE>'' from within
GENESIS.  Likewise, you may obtain a brief description of a GENESIS
object by typing ``showobject'' followed by the name of the object.</P>
<P>The GENESIS Reference Manual is primarily a summary of the syntax used by the
GENESIS Script Language Interpreter, the commands which it recognizes, and
of the main GENESIS ``objects'' which are available for constructing
simulations.  However, it will not tell you very much about the use of
GENESIS for the construction of neural simulations.  For a ``Users guide''
to GENESIS, we recommend ``The Book of GENESIS'', by James M. Bower and
David Beeman, Springer-Verlag (1998).  The free Internet Edition is available
at <A HREF="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/bog/bog.html">
http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/bog/bog.html</A>.</P>

<P>Part II of this book provides a detailed tutorial guide to the process of
constructing neural simulations with GENESIS.  These tutorials progress from
the construction of simple cell models to detailed cell and network models
with a sophisticated XODUS interface. For further information, see 
<A HREF="Manual-23.html#BoG">The Book of GENESIS</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Getting Started with GENESIS</A></H2>

<P>The GENESIS/XODUS documentation (Revelations) is contained within the
<EM>genesis/Doc</EM> and <EM>genesis/man</EM> directories.  The former
contains the main GENESIS documentation, and the latter contains UNIX
man pages for external utilities (such as convert), which are used
with GENESIS.  The README file in the <EM>Doc</EM> directory explains
the use of the on-line help facility.</P>

<P>The <EM>genesis/Scripts</EM> directory has a README file which describes the 
the database of simulations and its library of channels and other simulation
components (Numbers).</P>
<P>In addition to containing the C source code for GENESIS, the
<EM>genesis/src</EM> directory contains a README file and a commented
Makefile.  These files (Leviticus) give detailed instructions for the
compilation and installation of GENESIS.  They also suggest ways to
avoid common mistakes when installing GENESIS.  (For example,
an incorrect pathname to a system library is an abomination to the
compiler.)  We still haven't thought of a good excuse to call
something Deuteronomy, but are working on it.</P>
<P>After installing GENESIS, start the simulator with the command
``genesis''.  (In some cases, you may wish to use one of the command
options described in the documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#genesis">genesis</A>.)  After experimenting with the on-line help, your
first step should be to try out one of the demonstrations or tutorials
in the <EM>Scripts</EM> directory, following the directions in its
README file.  You may create your own simulations by modifying these
simulation scripts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Bugs"></A> <A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Reporting Bugs</A></H2>


<P>Most software has bugs, and GENESIS is no exception.  If you believe you
have found a bug, please follow the procedure outlined below.  Doing so
will vastly increase the speed with which the bug gets fixed.</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Simplify the simulation with the bug to the simplest possible
simulation that still contains the bug.  Doing so very often shows
that the bug is simply a script error that can be fixed by the user.
If not, send the simplified simulation along with a complete
description of the bug and any other pertinent information to
<EM>genesis@genesis-sim.org</EM>.  It is much easier to debug a simple
simulation than a large one with lots of irrelevant detail.  Thus,
even though you may be tempted to send us your entire 1,000,000-cell
hippocampal network simulation which includes thirty different cell
types and is self-aware, if you do we will probably never get around
to fixing the bug.  If you can do this and also run genesis using a
debugger like gdb, then that's even better; however, if you're that
advanced you probably don't need our help :-)
</LI>
<LI> Be courteous.  Telling us to "fix this bug or else!" will not produce
nearly as quick results as a polite request.  Neither will "fix this bug
right now; I'm using genesis for an assignment which is due in a week"
(yes, this has happened!).  Most of the GENESIS team does not get paid for
their work; we do this as a service to the community.  We have deadlines
just like you do.  However, it is not impolite to remind us of the bug if
we haven't done anything after a reasonable amount of time (say a couple of
weeks/months) or if we don't respond to your email quickly.
</LI>
<LI>If you experience any trouble compiling GENESIS, or encounter
segmentation violations (core dumps) when running GENESIS, please
visit the Bug-fixes directory on the GENESIS web site
before reporting problems.  The
<EM>README</EM> and <EM>compiling.problems</EM> files describe recent
bug fixes for GENESIS and give suggestions for dealing with commonly
encountered compilation problems.
</LI>
</OL>
</P>
