<H2><A NAME="Simulations"></A> <A NAME="s15">15. Simulations</A>    </H2>

<P>Broadly speaking, a GENESIS ``simulation'' consists of the following
components:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the complete collection of elements defined in the GENESIS environment
at the current time (except for elements excluded by the disable routine);
i.e., the elements that define the model, and accessory elements
</LI>
<LI>the object definitions that define how elements are to be interpreted
(e.g., definitions of objects, classes, and so forth)
</LI>
<LI>the set of messages that provide the way information is passed
among elements
</LI>
<LI> a schedule defining simulation activities and what elements are affected
</LI>
<LI> the set of simulation clocks defining the relative time for activities</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Sometimes, GENESIS users refer to a ``simulation'' as a specific
step-through of a given simulation setup (i.e., stepping through a
simulation, as defined above, over time) -- a ``run'' of a simulation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 Running a Simulation</A>    </H2>

<P>Many GENESIS routines help you construct simulations (see, for
example, 
<A HREF="Manual-8.html#Elements">Elements </a>, 
<A HREF="Manual-13.html#Messages">Messages </a>, 
<A HREF="#Clocks">Clocks </a>, and so forth).  The table below lists routines that
specifically deal with preparing the simulation for time-oriented
runs:</P>

</P>
<P>The step routine might be considered the central GENESIS routine -- it
runs the simulation, which is in a large part the whole point of
GENESIS.  In relation to the step routine, everything else you do in a
GENESIS simulation script is a preparation for running the simulation.</P>
<P>A typical sequence of events in running a simulation is as follows:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Set up the simulation environment (elements, messages, clocks, etc.)
Often, you will use the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#readcell">readcell</A> to
construct one or more cells from specifications contained in cell
parameter files.</LI>
<LI> Run the reset routine to establish the initial state for the run:
<PRE>
         genesis &gt; reset
    
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> Run the check routine to check for obvious specification errors:
<PRE>
         genesis &gt; check
    
</PRE>

If there are any errors, return to step 1 to revise the environment
as appropriate based on the check output.
</LI>
<LI>Run the step routine with a small step number (e.g., step 10) to test
whether the simulation will run reasonably:
<PRE>
         genesis &gt; step 10
</PRE>

If the simulation fails or shows odd results, figure out where the
problem is and return to step 1.  Often, this will involve some
experimentation with the step size used for the global simulation
clock, as described in 
<A HREF="#Clocks">Simulation Clocks</A>.
</LI>
<LI> Run the reset routine to prepare for the full run:
<PRE>
         genesis &gt; reset
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> Having determined that your simulation clocks are using an 
appropriate step size, 
run the step routine for a longer period of time.  If you are not using
graphics or interactive input, you may wish to place your
simulation job in the background.  For example:
<PRE>
         genesis &gt; step -time 10.0 -background
    
</PRE>

(The GENESIS prompt returns immediately but the simulation will
have started in the background, as you can confirm using the
showjobs routine.)</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>You may wish to practice these steps using the simple GENESIS
programming example scripts in the <EM>Scripts/tutorials</EM>
directory before you try to build and run your own model.</P>

<H3>Explicit vs. Implicit Integration Methods</H3>


<P>The documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#setmethod">setmethod</A> describes
the various numerical integration methods that may be used when
GENESIS performs a simulation.  The default Exponential Euler method
is a good compromise between speed, accuracy and ease of use for
network models and single cell models involving a small number of
compartments.  Multi-compartmental models result in numerically
``stiff'' equations that are best solved with one of the implicit
(Backward Euler or Crank-Nicholson) methods.  The implicit methods
are much faster, and allow the use of larger step sizes.  But, they
must be used in conjunction with the hsolve object, which takes over the
computations of compartments, symcompartments, tabchannels and other
selected element types.  (See the documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-26.html#hsolve">hsolve</A> and the section on 
<A HREF="#Clocks">Simulation Clocks</A>.)  </P>
<P>The following routines are designed to be used with hsolve elements:</P>

<H3>Running a Simulation in the Background</H3>

<P>To perform a GENESIS simulation in the background (for example if you want to
login from home over a modem, start a simulation, and logout while the
simulation continues to run), your simulation script should use no graphics,
and write all output to files.</P>
<P>Besides specifying the -nox option when starting genesis to avoid starting
XODUS, you also need to use the -notty and -batch options.  GENESIS will
attempt to read from stdin after the .simrc and command line script are
completed.  The -batch option causes genesis to exit rather than try to read
stdin.  -notty will avoid doing any terminal setup and cleanup procedures
which can also cause this type of behaviour.  You must specify both on the
command line (i.e. neither option implies the other).  In addition, you need
to redirect output (both stdout and stderr) to a file.   For example, a simple
script ``batchtest.g'' might look like:
<PRE>
//genesis script for a simple compartment simulation (Tutorial #1)
//batchtest.g

create neutral /cell
create compartment /cell/soma
setfield /cell/soma Rm 10 Cm 2 Em 25 inject 5

// send output to a file
    create asc_file /out
    setfield /out    flush 1    leave_open 1
    setclock 1 1.0
    useclock /out 1
    addmsg       /cell/soma     /out       SAVE Vm

setclock 0 0.001 // this is to make it run slowly
reset
step 100 -time
exit
</PRE>

To run this script in the background (using the C shell), you would use:
<PRE>
    genesis -nox -batch -notty batchtest &gt;& batch.log &
</PRE>

With the Bourne shell (or bash) it would be:
<PRE>
    genesis -nox -batch -notty batchtest &gt; batch.log 2&gt;&1 &
</PRE>
</P>
<P>When performing long simulation runs in the background, you can use a
<A HREF="Manual-26.html#disk_out">disk_out</A>, 
<A HREF="Manual-26.html#diskio">diskio</A>, or 
<A HREF="Manual-26.html#asc_file">asc_file</A> element
to save simulation results to disk at regular intervals. To save the
state of the model at the end of the run, use the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#save">save</A> or 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#simdump">simdump</A> command.</P>



<H2><A NAME="Clocks"></A> <A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 Simulation Clocks</A></H2>

<P>Each element in a simulation is associated with an interval timer or
``clock''.  This clock is used to determine how frequently the action
associated with the element (i.e., the INIT or PROCESS listed in the
simulation schedule) will be executed during the simulation process.
This is particularly useful when you want components of a simulation
to run at significantly different time scales.</P>
<P>By convention, clock number 0 is the global simulation clock or the basic
simulation time step.  All elements start out using clock 0 by default.</P>
<P>The simulator also contains an array of 100 independent clocks
(this is the number of available clocks; a typical simulation only
uses a few of these clocks).  Each clock is identified by a number
from 1 to 100 corresponding to its position in the clock array.
Clocks other than clock 0 must have settings larger than that of clock
0; these settings should be integer multiples of the clock 0 setting
for maximal timing precision.  </P>
<P>The setting of a specific clock is not some ``current time'', but is
the time increment used for stepping its associated elements through
the simulation.  The units used for time must be consistent with those
used for other related variables and parameters of the simulation.
For example, if membrane resistances and capacitances are expressed in
kilohms and microfarads, then times should be expressed in
milliseconds.  To make it easier to keep track of units, many (but not
all) GENESIS simulations use SI (MKS) units, and express time in
seconds.</P>
<P>For example, suppose clock 0 has the setting 1.0 (its default
setting), and you assign clock 1 the value 5.  If you then have a
graphical element use clock 1 for its simulation time, the graph
element would perform its simulation action (e.g., receiving a message
and plotting a value) only once every 5 steps taken by  the other elements.
This can greatly speed up a simulation, as the time increment used
for the display of information can usually be much larger than that
which is small enough for an accurate stepwise numerical solution of the
equations governing the model.</P>
<P>The following GENESIS routines are used for working with simulation clocks:</P>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
</P>

<H3>Choosing a Simulation Time Step   </H3>


<P>At each step of a simulation, each participating element typically
performs one or more computations.  Some elements perform a stepwise
numerical integration in order to solve the state equations of the
element they represent.  When setting up a simulation, you will need to
choose a global simulation clock step size which is small enough to
give accurate results, yet is large enough to give a reasonable
simulation speed.</P>
<P>You can empirically determine the time step used with an integration
method by decreasing the time step until the differences in simulation
results are within some criterion.  As a starting point, you should
pick a step which would yield a smooth curve if you were to make a
``connect-the-dots'' type of plot of the most rapidly varying
variable.  The size of the time step needed also depends on the
integration method which is used.  The documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#setmethod">setmethod</A> describes the several different ways
these integrals can be calculated.</P>
<P>Typically, you need around 10 microseconds for a neural simulation
with explicit methods (like the default Exponential Euler method) and
50 to 100 microseconds with the implicit methods (Backward Euler and
Crank-Nicholson). (For the implicit methods the limiting factor is often
the speed of the channel kinetics.)  Implicit methods are recommended when
there are many small compartments in a cell model, as these result in
numerically ``stiff'' equations.</P>
<P>There is a complication when using the implicit methods. These are inherently
not object oriented, and involve the construction of an ``hsolve''
element which takes over the computations for a specified cell.  (See the
documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-26.html#hsolve">hsolve</A>.)</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 GENESIS Jobs</A></H2>

<P>Certain compiled C functions available in GENESIS are designed to be run as
background jobs (e.g., the function XEventLoop, which oversees XODUS screen
events).  You can execute and monitor these background functions using the
following job routines:</P>
