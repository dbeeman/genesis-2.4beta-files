<H2><A NAME="SLI"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. The GENESIS Script Language Interpreter</A></H2>

<P>The GENESIS Script Language Interpreter (SLI) provides a framework in
which a simulation programmer can define and manipulate GENESIS
elements.  The SLI interprets statements in the GENESIS simulation
language, and constitutes the operating system ``shell'' at work when
you are running GENESIS.</P>
<P>The simulator shell is an interpretive operating environment which lets you:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> execute GENESIS routines (e.g., help, step, stop, openfile)</LI>
<LI> execute operating system shell commands (e.g., ls, cat, vi)</LI>
<LI> define variables (integer, floating point, or string types)</LI>
<LI> evaluate arithmetic expressions</LI>
<LI> invoke control structures such as conditionals and loops
(if...then, while, for, or foreach loops)</LI>
<LI> define and execute your own functions</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You can perform these operations in either of two ways:
<UL>
<LI> enter commands directly at the keyboard (the ``command line'')</LI>
<LI> read commands from text files (``scripts'')</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>User-defined SLI scripts are used to glue the pieces of a simulation together.
XODUS graphical objects that you use to define the front end of a simulation
and GENESIS data handlers are all controlled from SLI scripts.</P>
<P>The shell contains a library of basic commands which you can augment through
the addition of compiled C commands or interpreted SLI functions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Statements"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 GENESIS Statements and Commands</A></H2>

<P>GENESIS routines are called by entering a routine name followed by
any necessary arguments and options separated by whitespace.
<PRE>
  routine-name arg1 arg2 ... -option1 option1-arg1 ... -option2 ...
</PRE>
</P>
<P>A valid routine-name is a script identifier consisting
of any combination of alphabetic (A-Z or a-z) or
numeric (0-9) characters, or underscores (``_'') -- all other symbols are
invalid characters in an identifier.</P>
<P>Routine arguments consist of literal strings of characters, results of
other GENESIS routines or expressions, strings of characters including
whitespace enclosed in double quotes and the value of parameters passed
to a script or function.  Combinations of these which appear together
without any intervening whitespace are concatenated and passed as a single
argument to the routine.</P>
<P>Routine options follow command arguments, and are introduced by a dash
character.  Option names may be abbreviated to any unambiguous length.
Each option may accept additional arguments following the option name.</P>
<P>A carriage return marks the end of a statement, so you do not need to use
semicolons at the end of a line.  However, you can use semicolons to
terminate statements as a way to include multiple statements on a single line.
Several examples:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; reset; step 100

  genesis &gt; int a, b, c ;  a=1 ;  b=2 ;  c=3
  genesis &gt; if( a &lt; b); echo {a} is less than {b}; end
  1 is less than 2
</PRE>

In other cases, the ``command'' returns a value and might more properly
be called a function.  In the documentation for GENESIS commands, we will
use the term ``routine'' for built-in GENESIS commands, and will reserve the
term ``function'' for a script function that is written in the GENESIS
scripting language.  The procedure for creating your own functions is
described under 
<A HREF="#Functions">Functions</A>.</P>
<P>The following two examples illustrate how a routine call can be
supplied as the argument to another routine or as a value in a script
language expression:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; echo { getfield /neutral_test x }
  genesis &gt; float length = { getfield /cell/soma len }
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Routines used in the context of an argument to another routine or
within a script language expression must be enclosed in curly brackets.</P>
<P>All GENESIS statements are subject to these and other basic syntactical rules.
If a statement you submit violates these rules, the interpreter will respond
with an error message (and ignore your instruction).</P>


<H2><A NAME="Variables"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Creating Variables</A></H2>

<P>In GENESIS, you create a variable by entering a variable ``type'' specifier at
the command line, followed by the variable name
(a script identifier), optionally followed by a
value to assign to the variable:
<PRE>
    variable-type variable-name [= expression]
</PRE>

You can create any of three types of variables at the GENESIS shell:
<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>
Type </TD><TD> Meaning </TD><TD> Example Value</TD></TR><TR><TD>
int </TD><TD> integer number </TD><TD> 5, 18, 6000, -34</TD></TR><TR><TD>
float </TD><TD> double precision floating-point number </TD><TD> 5.0, 3.14, -2001.4</TD></TR><TR><TD>
str </TD><TD> character string </TD><TD> five, 5.0, hello</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

Here are some examples of correct variable declarations:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; int a
  genesis &gt; float PI = 3.141593
  genesis &gt; float myfloat = 2*PI
  genesis &gt; float floatstr = &quot;6.3&quot;
  genesis &gt; str hi = &quot;hello there&quot;
</PRE>

Note that case is significant for variable names (as in other areas): ``PI'' is
different from ``Pi'', which is different from ``pi''.  Also note that the
character sequence ``6.3'' could be the value of either a floating point
variable or a string variable.</P>
<P>Once you have defined a variable, you can change its value using an
assignment statement:
<PRE>
  variable-name = expression
</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; a = 40
  genesis &gt; myfloat = a + 2*PI
  genesis &gt; hi = &quot;The value of myfloat = &quot; @ myfloat
</PRE>

Note that GENESIS does not have array variables.  However, it has several
objects that contain internal data structures that may be used as arrays.
Further details are given in the documentation for
<A HREF="Manual-17.html#Tables">Tables and Arrays</A>.</P>

<H3>Local and Global Variables</H3>

<P>Variables declared in a function are local to the function.  Those
declared outside of a function in a script (or script that is
included with the ``include'' statement) are global variables.  When a
value is assigned to a global variable, it will affect any statements
or functions that follow this assignment.  One often refers to
``constants'' in a GENESIS script.  These are not true constants, but
are just variables thatare not expected to take on new values during
the course of a simulation.</P>
<P>Good object-oriented programming style discourages the use of global
variables.  When possible, it is best to localize variables within
functions, or to use oject fields to store values.  However, it is often
useful to use global variables in order to make them easily accessible
throughout the simulation scripts.  Scripts that create prototype channels
(see <EM>Scripts/neurokit/prototypes</EM>) usually define global variables for
ionic reversal potentials, and the cell reader (
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#readcell">readcell </a>) makes
use of the global variables RM, CM, RA and EREST_ACT.</P>
<P>GENESIS provides the following routines for accessing global script variables.
<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>
Routine </TD><TD>Description</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#addglobal">addglobal </a></TD><TD>Declares a global variable; variable name may be a variable.</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<A HREF="Manual-25.html#setglobal">setglobal </a></TD><TD>Sets value of global variable; variable name may be a variable.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</P>

<H3>Using Variables (The echo Command)</H3>

<P>Script variable values are retrieved by using the variable name in the
context of an expression.  Expressions are formed using variable names and
operators in the usual way.  (See 
<A HREF="#Operators">Operators</A>.)  In some contexts, the value of a variable or an expression
must be evaluated by by enclosing it in curly brackets in order to
distinguish between the string of characters and the value represented by
the character string.  This is particularly true when the expression is to
be evaluated as an argument of a GENESIS routine or script language
function.  (See 
<A HREF="#Functions">Functions</A>.)</P>
<P>The 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#echo">echo </a> routine is useful for seeing how an expression will be
evaluated:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; float pi = 3.14159
  genesis &gt; float y

  genesis &gt; y = pi/4
  genesis &gt; echo y
  y
  genesis &gt; echo {y}
  0.7853975
  genesis &gt; echo pi/4
  pi/4
  genesis &gt; echo {pi/4}
  0.7853975
  genesis &gt; echo {sin y}    // WRONG!
  0
  genesis &gt; echo {sin {y}}  // CORRECT
  0.7071063519
</PRE>
</P>
<P>As with many languages, GENESIS will cast expressions involving both
floating point and integer variables to floating point.  It will also
convert a string to a float if the string is a valid representation of a
number.  For example,
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; int i = 5
  genesis &gt; int j = 2
  genesis &gt; float x = 2
  genesis &gt; str num = &quot;5&quot;
  genesis &gt; echo {i/j}
  2
  genesis &gt; echo {i/x}
  2.5
  genesis &gt; echo {num/2}
  2.5
  genesis &gt; num = &quot;i/x&quot;
  genesis &gt; echo {num}
  i/x
  genesis &gt; echo {{num}/2}
  ** Error - CastToFloat: Error casting 'i/x', using 0.0
  0
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Often it is useful to use a string variable name to hold the name of a
global variable.  For example, one may want to pass the name of a global
variable to a function that declares, sets, or retrieves the value of the
variable.  However, normal GENESIS syntax for declarations and assignments
does not permit a variable a name to be specified by a string variable.
The last three of the following GENESIS statements are illegal, and will
produce error messages:
<PRE>
  str name = &quot;foo&quot;
  float x

  float {name}  // want &quot;float foo&quot;
  {name} = 5.5  // want &quot;foo = 5.5&quot;
  x = {{name}}   // want &quot;x = foo&quot;, or equivalently, &quot;x = {foo}&quot;
</PRE>

The correct way to accomplish these results is to use the routines for
accessing global script variables with the name of the global variable
held in a string variable.
<PRE>
  addglobal float {name}
  setglobal {name} 5.5
  x = {getglobal {name}}
</PRE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="Functions"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Functions</A></H2>

<P>As with any programing language, GENESIS lets you define
functions in order to make your script programs more modular
and easier to modify.  You should group function definitions
together at the beginning of a script, preceding any
statements that will use them.
The listglobals routine will list any user-defined functions.</P>

<P>The general form of a function definition in GENESIS is:
<PRE>
        function function-name [ (arg1 [, arg ... ] ) ]
          statement-1
            .
            .
            .
          statement-n
        end
</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>
        function print_area(length, diameter)
            float length, diameter
            float area
            float PI=3.14159
            area = PI*diameter*length
            echo The area is {area}
        end

        function link_compartment(channel,compartment)
            addmsg {channel} {compartment} RAXIAL Ra previous_state
            addmsg {compartment} {channel} AXIAL previous_state
        end
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The SLI also lets you define functions interactively at the GENESIS prompt.
For example:
<PRE>
        genesis &gt; function my_echo(inputval)
        ? echo { inputval }
        ? end
        genesis &gt; listglobals
        function        my_echo
        genesis &gt; my_echo 33
        33              
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The <EM>return</EM> keyword allows a return from the function before
the end statement.  It may optionally be used to return a value.  For
example:
<PRE>
        function make_positive(num)  // a silly version of &quot;abs&quot;
            float num
            if (num &gt;= 0)
                return {num}
            else
                return {abs {num}}
            end
        end
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You are not allowed to define a function within another function.
Normally, you cannot refer to a function in another function before it is
defined.  For example, the following script will produce an error message:
<PRE>
        function func2
            func1 &quot;This is a test.&quot;
        end

        function func1(string)
            str string
            echo &quot;The value of the string is: &quot; {string}
        end

        func2
</PRE>
</P>
<P>However, adding the line
<PRE>
        extern func1
</PRE>
</P>
<P>at the beginning of the script will give the desired result:
<PRE>
        The value of the string is:  This is a test.
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The keywords <EM>function</EM>, <EM>return</EM>, <EM>end</EM>, and
<EM>extern</EM> are features of the interpreter, not normal GENESIS commands;
consequently, they do not appear in a listing of GENESIS routines (e.g., as
given by the listcommands routine).</P>
<P>The routines 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#argc">argc</A> and 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#argv">argv</A> are often used inside of function definitions to return
the number of arguments and the array of arguments which are passed to
the function.</P>



<H2><A NAME="Operators"></A> <A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Operators</A></H2>

<P>The table below lists the basic operators available in GENESIS, from highest
to lowest precedence.  These operators can be applied to variables or
constants within a GENESIS expression.</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>
Operators </TD><TD> Function</TD></TR><TR><TD>
- </TD><TD> unary minus</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<CODE>**</CODE> </TD><TD> power</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<CODE>*</CODE> / % ~ </TD><TD> multiply, divide, modulo (int only), bitwise complement</TD></TR><TR><TD>
+ - &amp; | ^ @ </TD><TD> add, subtract, bitwise and, bitwise or,</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> bitwise xor, string concatenation</TD></TR><TR><TD>
! </TD><TD> logical complement</TD></TR><TR><TD>
&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= == != </TD><TD> relational operators (perform both numeric</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD><TD> and string comparisons)</TD></TR><TR><TD>
&amp;&amp; || </TD><TD> logical and, logical or</TD></TR><TR><TD>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

NOTES:  Unary minus is supported, but unary plus is not (thus -10 is
valid while +10 is not).</P>
<P>The following examples illustrate the use of several of the basic operators.</P>
<P>For string concatenation, the ``@'' operator is used:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; echo {&quot;sub&quot; @ &quot;genius&quot;}
  subgenius
</PRE>

The following command shows how precedence is employed:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; echo { 24 / 12 + 7 * 2 }
  16
</PRE>

You can also explicitly specify the precedence of operations in an expression
by using parentheses:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; echo { 3 * 4 + 5 }
  17
  genesis &gt; echo { 3 * (4 + 5 ) }
  27
</PRE>

The following command does not return 5.4 because each element of the
expression is an integer:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; echo { 9 * 3 / 5 } 
  5
</PRE>

For comparisons in GENESIS, the integer 0 is considered False; all other
integer values are considered True; GENESIS returns 1 to indicate True.  The
following command returns 1 because the expression is True (it would have
returned 0 if the expression had been False):
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; echo { 4 &gt; 2 }
  1
</PRE>

Here is an example of negation in determining the nonexistence of an element:
<PRE>
  if (!{exists {dest}/soma})
     ...
</PRE>

The relational operators are
defined to be non-associative.  This prevents silly expressions like the
following:
<PRE>
  1 &lt; 2 &lt; 4                                     [WRONG]
</PRE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="Control"></A> <A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Control Structures</A></H2>

<P>GENESIS supports four kinds of conditional control structures:
<OL>
<LI> if/elif/else/end</LI>
<LI> while/end</LI>
<LI> for/end</LI>
<LI> foreach/end</LI>
</OL>

Each of these control structures is briefly described here.</P>
<P>Note that you can break out of any of these loops before their expected
termination by using the ``break'' or ``return'' statements.</P>


<H3>if/elif/else/end Structure</H3>

<P>The GENESIS ``if ...'' conditional structure takes the following form:
<PRE>
    if (expression)
      statements
    elif (expression)
      statements
    else
      statements
    end
</PRE>

The elif and else portions of the form are optional and multiple
elif portions may appear.</P>
<P>The ``if''/``elif'' expressions are evaluated in the order of
appearance.  When an expression evaluates ``true'', all
the statements between the ``true'' expression and the following
matching ``elif'', ``else'' or ``end'' will be executed; if all
evaluated expressions are ``false'', then the
statements between the ``else'' and the ``end'' are executed (or no
statements are executed if there is no ``else'' clause).</P>
<P>Note that the GENESIS if construct does not recognize the keyword ``then''.</P>
<P>These are some examples of valid if statements:
<PRE>
  if(1)
    echo hello
  end

  if(1); echo hello; end

  if( (GRAPHICS == 1) || (5+3 &gt; 10) )
    echo hello
  end
</PRE>

The following function uses the if/elif/else/end construct and prints
``zero'', ``negative'' or ``positive'' depending on the first
argument:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
    function iftest(arg)
        int arg
        if ( arg  == 0 ) 
            echo zero
        elif ( arg &lt; 0 )
             echo negative
        else
             echo positive
        end
    end
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>while/end Structure</H3>

<P>The GENESIS ``while ...'' conditional looping statement has the following
syntax:
<PRE>
   while (expression)
        statements
   end
</PRE>

The expression is evaluated.  If it is ``true'' (i.e., not 0), then all the
statements will be executed, then the expression will be evaluated again; if
the evaluated expression is ``false'', then all the
statements are skipped and control is turned to the first statement after
the ``end''.</P>
<P>An example of a while loop is the following:
<PRE>
    str parent
    while({getfield {parent} object-&gt;name} != &quot;xgraph&quot;)
        parent = {el {parent}/..}
    end
</PRE>

Note that the expression can be complicated and can involve some of the actual
work of the loop.</P>

<H3>for/end</H3>

<P>The GENESIS ``for ...'' conditional structure uses an incrementable variable
in assessing the condition for continuing through the loop.  The syntax of
the loop is as follows:
<PRE>
    for (init_assignment; expression; incr_assignment)
      statements
    end
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The init_assignment is an assignment statement which is evaluated
once prior to entering the loop.  The incr_assignment is an
assignment statment which is executed following the statements
each time through the loop.  Otherwise, the for/end statement
operates in the same manner as while/end.</P>
<P>To print the numbers one through ten:
<PRE>
    int i

    for (i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i = i + 1)
        echo {i}
    end
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>foreach/end</H3>

<P>The GENESIS ``foreach'' statement loops through a set of statements
once for each item in a specified argument list, having assigned the
value of each item in the list to a looping variable for use by the
statements:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  foreach loop-var ( arg1 [ arg ...] )
    statements
  end
</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>
  str s
  str thingys = &quot;foo bar baz&quot;
  foreach s ({arglist {thingys}})
      echo {s}
  end
</PRE>

or
<PRE>
  str name
  foreach name ({el {path}/##[OBJECT=xform]})
    xshow {name}
  end
</PRE>

The use of wildcards in the specification of pathnames is described in
the section 
<A HREF="Manual-9.html#Tree"> Hierarchical Structure</A>.  Also see
the documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#arglist">arglist </a> and 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#el">el </a> (``element list'').
Note that in each of these examples, you need to have declared the
variables used in the loop before their use in the loop.</P>
