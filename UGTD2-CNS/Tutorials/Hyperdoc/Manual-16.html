<P>When a request is made to execute a simulation with the step
command, the simulator determines what to do by consulting the
simulation ``schedule'' -- a list of operations which are to be
performed in the specified order for each simulation step.  For
example, the default schedule for GENESIS simulations is given in
the script <EM>startup/schedule.g</EM>, which contains:</P>

     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=buffer]      -action INIT
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=segment]     -action INIT
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=device]      -action INIT
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=buffer]      -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=projection]  -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=spiking]     -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=gate] -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=segment][CLASS!=membrane][CLASS!=gate] \
        [CLASS!=concentration][CLASS!=concbuffer] -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=membrane]    -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=hsolver]     -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=concentration]       -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=concbuffer]  -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=device]      -action PROCESS
     addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=output]      -action PROCESS

<P>Each operation listed in the schedule is simply a compiled C function (listed
by its C name) with optional arguments.  The C function used by default is
named ``Simulate'', and it is called with two arguments: a wildcard path
specification indicating the set of elements affected, and the element-type
action to perform for that class of elements during the simulation step.</P>
<P>Scheduling provides a way to specify the order of events within a given
simulation step, in terms of which elements will be computed in what
sequence.  For example, you may verify, using the showobject command to
determine the class memberships, that using the default schedule listed
above, the PROCESS action is carried out on a tabgate element before it is
carried out on a vdep_channel to which it might be coupled.  The compartment
containing this channel will execute the PROCESS action after the channel.
This insures that all computations are performed in the proper order.</P>
<P>If you need to have the computations for the elements in your simulation
run in a specific order, you could define your own simulation schedule.
Note that the simulation schedule gives no control over the order in which
the RESET action is performed, however.  If the initial state of one
element depends on the initial state of another element, you may need to
call the RESET action for specific elements in the proper order.  Further
details are given in the section on 
<A HREF="Manual-8.html#Actions">Actions</A> and
the documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#reset">reset </a>.  </P>
<P>The following GENESIS routines are used for establishing and working
with simulation schedules.  The documentation for 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#addtask">addtask </a>
gives more information on constructing your own simulation schedules.</P>

</P>
<P>Whether you create a new schedule or not, you should also run the check
routine, which analyzes the simulation schedule to check for conflicts or
inconsistencies.  For example, you should always run check if you change the
schedule or add or remove any simulation elements; you may need to just run
resched, or revise the schedule itself.
