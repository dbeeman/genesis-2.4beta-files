<P>Elements within a GENESIS simulation communicate by a system of links called
``messages'', which allow one element to access the data fields of another
element.  Once the message link to or from an element have been established,
the element is able to receive or send information each time its state is
updated during the simulation.</P>
<P>Messages have no time delay and serve to unify a large number of
elements into a single computational unit.
They are used, for example, in detailed compartmental models of cells
to link together membrane compartments and channels into a single
electrical entity.  The section on 
<A HREF="Manual-14.html#Connections">Synaptic Connections</A> describes how messages are used for communication
between neurons.</P>
<P>It is not feasible to summarize all of the GENESIS messages here, because the
message name and parameters are specific to the object that receives the
message.  An element can send any message, and will not complain even if the
message is not a valid GENESIS message.  However, the destination element will
check to see that it is a valid message name for that object and that it has
the correct number of parameters.
If the showobject command, or the documentation for an object is inadequate to
explain what a given message really does, look at the MSGLOOP section of the
source code for that object.</P>
<P>The GENESIS routines used for establishing and working with messages include
the following:</P>

</P>
<P>For example, at each step of a simulation, one asymmetric compartment
connected to another asymmetric compartment needs to send both its
axial resistance <EM>Ra</EM> and its membrane potential as of the
previous simulation step (<EM>previous_state</EM>) to the second compartment.
This allows the second compartment to calculate the current entering
from the first.</P>
<P>You establish such a message link using the addmsg command.  In the
following command the dendrite compartment is linked to the soma with
a message of the type RAXIAL, and a message link is established
whereby two value fields, <EM>Ra</EM> and <EM>previous_state</EM>,
will be sent from the dendrite to the soma at each simulation step:
<PRE>
  addmsg /cell/dend /cell/soma RAXIAL Ra previous_state
</PRE>

This establishes the information flow from the dendrite to the soma.  In the
reverse direction, the dendrite needs to receive the value of the soma's
previous membrane potential in order to update its own state (the dendrite
already knows its own axial resistance to the soma, and so the message need
not include information regarding axial resistance).  This link can be set up
as follows:
<PRE>
  addmsg /cell/soma /cell/dend AXIAL  previous_state
</PRE>

Messages do not have to be between computational elements only.  The
following example shows how the soma would plot the value of its
<EM>Vm</EM> field (the membrane potential) by sending a PLOT message
to the xgraph element /graphs/Vmgraph (the last two arguments give the
label and color to be used in plotting this field):
<PRE>
  addmsg /cell/soma /graphs/Vmgraph PLOT Vm *voltage *red
</PRE>

To find out the allowed message types and and associated fields for an element
type, you use the showobject routine.  For example:
<PRE>
  showobject compartment
</PRE>

This routine produces, along with other information, the following list of
valid messages for objects of the type compartment:
<PRE>
  VALID MESSAGES
        [6] EREST                : Em
        [3] INJECT               : inject
        [2] AXIAL                : Vm
        [1] RAXIAL               : Ra Vm
        [0] CHANNEL              : Gk Ek
</PRE>

In order to determine which messages have been established for a
specific element, you can use the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#showmsg">showmsg </a> routine, which
lists the incoming and outgoing messages for an element.  For example,
showmsg produces the following results when you run the Neuron
tutorial in <EM>Scripts/neuron</EM>:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; showmsg /cell/dend1
  INCOMING MESSAGES
  MSG 0 from '/cell/soma'  type [2] 'AXIAL' &lt; Vm = 0 &gt;
  MSG 1 from '/cell/dend2'  type [1] 'RAXIAL' &lt; Ra = 7960 &gt; &lt; Vm = 0 &gt;
  MSG 2 from '/cell/dend1/Ex_channel'  type [0] 'CHANNEL' &lt; Gk = 0 &gt;
        &lt; Ek = -10 &gt;
  MSG 3 from '/cell/dend1/Inh_channel'  type [0] 'CHANNEL' &lt; Gk = 0 &gt;
        &lt; Ek = -80 &gt;
  MSG 4 from '/input/injectpulse/dend1curr'  type [3] 'INJECT' &lt; inject = 0 &gt;

  OUTGOING MESSAGES
  MSG 0 to '/cell/soma' type [1] 'RAXIAL' &lt; Ra = 7960 &gt; &lt; Vm = 0 &gt;
  MSG 1 to '/cell/dend2' type [2] 'AXIAL' &lt; Vm = 0 &gt;
  MSG 2 to '/cell/dend1/Ex_channel' type [0] 'VOLTAGE' &lt; Vm = -70 &gt;
  MSG 3 to '/cell/dend1/Inh_channel' type [0] 'VOLTAGE' &lt; Vm = -70 &gt;
  MSG 4 to '/output/dend1graphs/dend1Vm_grf' type [0] 'PLOT' &lt; data = -70 &gt;
        &lt; name = dend1 &gt; &lt; color = black &gt;
</PRE>

Although showmsg is useful for providing debugging information when
used interactively at the GENESIS prompt, its output is not in a
convenient form for use within a script.  In this case, you would use
the 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#getmsg">getmsg </a> routine.  Here are some examples using getmsg:
<PRE>
  genesis &gt; echo { getmsg /cell/dend1 -outgoing -type 1 }
  AXIAL

  genesis &gt; echo { getmsg /cell/dend1 -outgoing -source 1}
  /cell/dend1

  genesis &gt; echo { getmsg /cell/dend1 -out -destination 1 }
  /cell/dend2

  genesis &gt; echo { getmsg /cell/dend1 -out -count }
  5
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#deletemsg">deletemsg </a> command removes message links.  For example,
to remove the input to the to the dend1 compartment from the channel
Inh_channel, you would remove incoming message 3 and outgoing message
3, of the messages listed above.  This would be done with the statements:
<PRE>
  deletemsg /cell/dend1 3 -incoming
  deletemsg /cell/dend1 3 -outgoing
</PRE>

The PLOT message from a compartment /cell/soma to a graph
/data/voltage could be located and deleted with:
<PRE>
  deletemsg /data/voltage -in 0 -find /cell/soma PLOT
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The various options for 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#addmsg">addmsg </a>, 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#showmsg">showmsg </a>, 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#getmsg">getmsg </a>, and 
<A HREF="Manual-25.html#deletemsg">deletemsg </a> are described in the Command
Reference section.</P>
