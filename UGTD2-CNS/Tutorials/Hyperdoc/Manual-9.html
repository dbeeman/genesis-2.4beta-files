<H2><A NAME="Tree"></A> <A NAME="s9">9. Hierarchical Structure</A></H2>

<P>Typically, simulations are constructed of many different types of elements
with different relationships to each other, mediated by the exchange of
messages.  In order to keep track of the structure of such a simulation,
elements are organized into a tree hierarchy similar to that of the directory
structure in the UNIX operating system.  Obviously, as a simulation becomes
more sophisticated, this tree structure can become many levels deep.
Nevertheless, if you organize this structure properly, it will reflect the
natural organization of the system.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 The GENESIS Element Tree Hierarchy</A></H2>

<P>Elements are stored in the GENESIS element tree.  A particular element is
uniquely identified by a path name.  The root of this tree has a path of ``/''.
The user can attach elements to this tree (at first as children of the root
and then later as children of these children).  The structure mimics that of
the UNIX file system.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Traversing the Element Tree</A></H2>

<P>You use the following GENESIS routines to navigate the element tree.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Pathnames and Wildcards</A></H2>

<P>Each element has a unique name which is fully specified by giving its pathname
within the hierarchy.  Pathnames are of the form:
<PRE>
    name/name
</PRE>

or
<PRE>
    /name/name
</PRE>

The first form specifies a path relative to the current element.  The second
form is an absolute path from the top or ``root'' of the hierarchy.
By analogy with UNIX directory names, the name may be an actual
element name, ``.'' (the current element), or ``..'' (the parent element).</P>
<P>Many commands can operate on more than a single element at a time.  Wildcard
paths can be used to specify multiple elements which satisfy the specified
conditions.</P>

<P>A wildcard path is of the form
<PRE>
    name[index][condition]
</PRE>

The wildcard name can be absent or can be one of
<PRE>
    a#b    a?b    ##      #
</PRE>

If an index is specified, it can be one of
<PRE>
  index:       []     [n]    [n-m]
</PRE>

One or more optional conditions may be specified in one of the forms
<PRE>
    [field  operator value]
    [CLASS  operator classname]
    [OBJECT operator objectname]
    [TYPE   operator objectname]
    [ISA    operator objectname]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>where the allowed operators are
<PRE>
    = &lt;&gt; != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Field values are floating point numeric values. 
   Class and object names are strings.
</P>
<P>Note that white space is NOT allowed anywhere in the wildcard
specification.  The # matches strings of any length while ? matches
single characters.  The ## is a special name which specifies
searches down the entire subtree rather than at a single level.</P>
<P>For example, a path that specified all elements that had name beginning
with ``cell'' with x coordinates greater than 5 and less than 10 would
be:
<PRE>
    /cell#[x&gt;5][x&lt;10]
</PRE>
</P>

<P>Note that the # and ## DO NOT expand indexed elements.  For
example, given the following list of elements:
<PRE>
    /TEST[0] /TEST[1] /TEST[2] /TEST[3] /TEST[4] /THESE[0] /THESE[1] 
</PRE>

The command
<PRE>
    echo {el /#}
</PRE>

would produce only
<PRE>
    /TEST /THESE
</PRE>

while 
<PRE>
    echo {el /#[]}
</PRE>

would give
<PRE>
  /TEST /TEST[1] /TEST[2] /TEST[3] /TEST[4]
  /THESE /THESE[1]
</PRE>

Note that <CODE>/TEST</CODE> is the same as <CODE>/TEST[0]</CODE>.</P>
<P>The use of the ``<CODE>[]</CODE>'' wildcard notation for indexed elements
is useful for setting fields of indexed elements, for example,
<PRE>
    setfield /randomspike[] rate 200
</PRE>

It can also be used with the addmsg command:
<PRE>
    // Provide injection to soma of cell[0], cell[1], cell[2], etc.
    addmsg /waveform /cell[]/soma INJECT output
</PRE>
</P>
<P>A path that would specify all elements in the hierarchy that
belong to the channel class would be:
<PRE>
    /##[CLASS=channel]
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The OBJECT identifier (and its older name, TYPE) is used to specify
elements which were created from a given object.  For example,
<PRE>
    setfield /##[OBJECT=xgraph] bg white
</PRE>

will set the background to white for all graphs which were created
from the xgraph object.  The X1compat libray of XODUS 1 compatible
objects and commands uses the xgraph object as the basis of an
extended object, x1graph.  Elements which are created from the x1graph
object will not be affected by the statement above.  The ISA
identifier is used instead of OBJECT to include elements created from
objects that were derived from a specified object.  For
example,
<PRE>
    setfield /##[ISA=xgraph] bg white
</PRE>

It is also possible to specify comma separated lists of wildcard path
specifications, for example:
<PRE>
    showfield soma/#[OBJECT=Ca_concen],basal_8/#[OBJECT=Ca_concen] Ca
</PRE>
