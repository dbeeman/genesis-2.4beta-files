Starting with version 2.0.2, GENESIS now comes with a hypertext version of
the GENESIS Reference Manual and on-line help files.  These files are in the
genesis/Hyperdoc directory, and the main file is Manual.html.  In order to
properly view the hypertext documentation, you will need a web browser with
support for HTML 3 tables, such as Mozilla or any recent browser.

To bring up the documentation, just start the browser, specifying the
URL as genesis/Hyperdoc/Manual.html.
