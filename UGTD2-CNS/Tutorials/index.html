<P> The GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials are an evolving package of
HTML tutorials intended to teach the process of constructing
biologically realistic neural models with the GENESIS simulator.  This
version is derived from tutorials used at the first annual meeting of
the World Association of Modelers (WAM) Biologically Accurate Modeling
Meeting (BAMM), held March 31st - April 2nd 2005, in San Antonio,
Texas.  It was further developed during use in the Frankfurt Institute
of Advanced Studies (FIAS 2006) summer school on theoretical
neuroscience and complex systems, and the Latin American School on
Computational Neuroscience (LASCON 2006-2014).

<P>
Versions of these tutorials, and many of the Advanced Tutorials from
WAM-BAMM*05, have been published in article form (both in browseable HTML
and downloadable PDF format) in the November 2005 special issue on
Realistic Neural Modeling in the electronic journal Brains, Minds, and
Media (<A
HREF="http://www.brains-minds-media.org/">http://www.brains-minds-media.org/
</A>). Brains, Minds, and Media is an open access (free) eJournal for
interactive and visual media in the neural and cognitive sciences.  The
journal provides peer-reviewed articles, software and interactive media for
the neural and cognitive sciences with a particular focus on both education
and teaching, and research on the relation between brains, minds and media.

version of the Tutorials package, which contains additional material
from the GENESIS web site and the GENESIS Users Group (BABEL) archives
of models.

<P> This HTML document is an expanded version of various presentations on
the use of GENESIS for realistic neural modeling given at GENESIS users
meetings (GUM 2002, WAM-BAMM 2005 and 2006), the EU Advanced Course on
Computational Neuroscience, the Latin American School on Computational
Neuroscience (LASCON 2006 and 2008) and the Frankfurt Institute of Advanced
Studies (FIAS 2006) summer school on theoretical neuroscience and
complex systems.

<b>Part I - Modeling the Brain: Simplified vs. Realistic Models:</b>
This gives an overview of realistic neural modeling and the levels of
detail that a model may require.
<P>

<b>Part II - Brief Overview of Realistic Neural Modeling Techniques:</b>
This is a general overview and introduction to
compartmental cell modeling and realistic network simulation for the
beginner.  Although examples are drawn from GENESIS simulations, the
tutorial emphasizes the general modeling approach, rather than the details
of using any particular simulator.
<P><b>Part III - Getting Started with Modeling Using GENESIS:</b>
This builds upon the background of Part II to describe some deails of how
this approach is used to construct cell and network simulations in GENESIS.
It serves as an introduction and roadmap to the extended
hands-on <A HREF="genprog/genprog.html">GENESIS Modeling Tutorial</A>.

<A HREF="genprog/genprog.html"><H2>GENESIS Modeling Tutorial</H2></A>

<P> This is the main tutorial of the package, and is intended to be a
"quick start" to creating simulations with GENESIS.  It should give you the
tools and enough information to let you quickly begin creating cells and
networks with GENESIS, making use of the provided example simulations.
Advanced topics are covered by apppropriate links to optional tutorial
material in the <A HREF="advanced-tutorials/index.html"> Advanced Tutorials
on Realistic Neural Modeling</A>.


<A HREF="README.html"><H2>The "README" file</H2></A>
<P> This tells you how to obtain, install, and run GENESIS and the
GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials package.
<P>


<H2>The <A HREF="cells/index.html">cells/</A> and <A
HREF="networks/index.html">networks/</A> directories</H2>
<P>These browseable directories contain GENESIS cell and network models
that are used or referenced in the GENESIS Modeling Tutorial.

<A HREF="unixhelp/unixhelp.html"><H2>Introduction to UNIX or
Linux</H2></A>
<P>
This is a short guide to getting around in the UNIX command line
environment for Windows and Mac users.

<H2>An Introduction to Computational Neuroscience</H2></A>

<P> These "webified" introductory lectures on computational neuroscience
and realistic neural modeling are derived from lecture notes for an
introductory biomedical engineering course at the University of Colorado.
It has sections on the Hodgkin-Huxley model and compartmental modeling that
might be useful to those who are studying them for the first time, or who
need some review.
