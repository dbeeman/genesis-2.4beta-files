<h1><a name="section-1">Parallel I/O Issues</a></h1>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>This file describes some extensions to GENESIS objects (xview) and
modified objects (par_asc_file and par_disk_out) that are used for
output of data in parallel GENESIS.
</p>
<h2><a name="section-1.1">xview extensions</a></h2>
<p>
Parallel simulations can often benefit from visualizations with XODUS
during development, and often will require large input and/or output
files in full scale production runs. However, modelers should be aware
that
the way these I/O issues are dealt with can have a considerable
impact on performance.
</p>
<p>PGENESIS includes a capability to allow multiple nodes to display on
the same
XODUS widget so that, for example, a single xview element can be used
to show
activation of all the cells in a distributed V1 layer. In serial
GENESIS
there are several ways to set up input to an xview element, described
in "The
Book of GENESIS" chapter on Advanced XODUS Techniques and in the
documentation
for xview in the GENESIS Reference Manual. However, the one we must use
for
internode communication in PGENESIS is to set up remote messages from a
source
element to a destination xview element. This is done by using the
PGENESIS
raddmsg command. (See Doc/refman.txt.)
</p>
<p>If every node were to set up COORDS and VAL n messages
independently, the VAL
messages could easily get associated with the wrong COORDS messages,
depending
on the order in which the particular add message requests were handled.
To
deal with this difficulty, the GENESIS xview object has been extended
to allow
IVAL n messages to be associated with a particular ICOORDS message. The
user
does this by choosing an integral index with each message that is set
up, and
passing it as the first parameter of the ICOORDS and IVALn messages.
IVAL1
through IVAL5 messages will be associated with ICOORDS messages having
the
same index. For an example of this, see the example script
Scripts/orient2/V1.g in the PGENESIS distribution and the serial
GENESIS
documentation for xview.
</p>
<h2><a name="section-1.2">Output to files</a></h2>
<p>
PGENESIS also includes a capability for writing a single disk file
from multiple nodes. For disk output in serial GENESIS, it is typical
to create an asc_file element and then set up a SAVE message that will
cause a value to be written to a file on every time step. In PGENESIS
it is possible to add such messages from elements on various nodes.
However, there is no guarantee of order for the normal asc_file
object, so in PGENESIS the par_asc_file object is provided. When SAVE
messages are set up, the first parameter is an integral index that is
used to maintain a fixed ordering among all of the various incoming
messages to the par_asc_file element. This integral index should be
unique and in the range from 0 to the number of incoming messages
minus 1, inclusive.
</p>
<p>Serial GENESIS uses the disk_out object for writing array data to a
file in
an efficient binary format. We have similarly provided a corresponding
par_disk_out object that takes an added integral index parameter. The
scripts output.g and V1.g in the Scripts/orient2 directory of the
PGENESIS
distribution illustrate the use of this object.
</p>
<p>This example shows how raddmsg is used to send a "SAVE index data"
message
from the source element to the destination par_asc_file or par_disk_out
element. The index is an added field of the source object that can be
any
variable with a unique integer value. The integral index simply
provides
an ordering for the messages, so that if many messages are being sent
in
parallel, there will be a deterministic order to them when they written
to
a file (in the case of par_asc_file or par_disk_out) or displayed (in
the
case of an xview object). Also see the serial GENESIS documentation for
asc_file and disk_out.
</p>
<p>Both of these extensions for I/O support require that information
flow
in the form of PGENESIS messages from the source node to the
destination node (which holds the xview, par_asc_file, or par_disk_out
element). If you are doing very large amounts of I/O from many nodes,
the destination node would likely become a simulation bottleneck. In
those situations, it would likely be advantageous to consider a
solution where each node was doing its I/O to and from files on the
local disk, rather than using the above mechanisms.
