<p>In network models typically axonal delays are one or two orders of
magnitude greater than the simulation step for prcesses within a single
cell.  A spike generated at simulation time <em> T </em> need not
be delivered to a destination cell until time <em> T + LT </em> where
LT is the axonal delay.  This allows simulation nodes to operate
in a loosely synchronized fashion, some being ahead of others, and
it allows nodes to continue updating their cells while incoming spikes
are in transit over the physical medium (e.g., Ethernet) which connects
the CPUs.  The amount of simulation time by which node A can get ahead
of node B and still be sure it has not missed any spikes is known as
the <b> lookahead </b> of A with respect to B.

<p>In PGENESIS lookahead is controlled with three commands <a
href="ref/setlookahead.txt">setlookahead</a>, <a
href="ref/getlookahead.txt">getlookahead</a>, and <a
href="ref/showlookahead.txt">showlookahead</a>.  The lookahead of node
A with respect to node B is the minimum delay on all data paths from B
to A i.e., the minimum axonal delay over all the connections from B to
A.  If there are no axonal paths from B to A, the lookahead is
infinite because A's activity does not depend on B's.  If there are
non-spike messages, lookahead is <b>dt</b> because those messages
deliver data on the next timestep.  Additionally PGENESIS must be
instructed to execute steps <a href="asyncstep.html">asynchronously</a>.

<p>It is wise to partition a model in such a way as to maximize
lookahead between every pair of nodes.
