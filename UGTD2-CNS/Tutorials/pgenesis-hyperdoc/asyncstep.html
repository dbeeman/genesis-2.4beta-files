<p>By default PGENESIS synchronizes all nodes in a zone prior to
executing each simulation step.  This safety measure introduces
significant wait time while the nodes communicate that they are
all ready to execute a step.  A script can instruct PGENESIS to
skip this synchronization so that nodes execute asynchronously:

<p><b>set /post sync_before_step 0</b>

<p>or conversely, for synchronous execution:

<p><b>set /post sync_before_step 1</b>

<p>Under asynchronous simulation the only constraint limiting how
far in simulation time a node can advance is the set of incoming
messages.  If node A receives a non-spike message from node B, then
A is constrained to wait at step T+dt for data from B from time T (i.e.,
A cannot get ahead of B).  The constraint for spike messages is more
relaxed, and is controlled by the <a href="lookahead.html">lookahead</a>
settings.
