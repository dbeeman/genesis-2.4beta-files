<hr><br>
Parallel GENESIS is installed on supercomputers at PSC where it may
be used by U.S.-based researchers free of charge, subject to approval
of a submitted <a href="http://www.psc.edu/grants/grants.html">application</a>.&nbsp;
The primary production platform is the <a
 href="http://www.psc.edu/machines/tcs/lemieux.html">Lemieux</a>
supercomputer with 3000 Alpha EV6.8 processors (see <a
 href="lemieux.html">Running PGENESIS on Lemieux</a> for details). We
have also ported the
code to the recently installed 2000 processor <a
 href="http://www.psc.edu/machines/cray/xt3/bigben.html">Cray XT3</a>.&nbsp;
For simulations with very large memory requirements (up to 256GB), we
have installed PGENESIS on <a
 href="http://www.psc.edu/machines/marvel/rachel.html">rachel</a>, an
HP Marvel computer (SMP architecture).&nbsp; Inquiries regarding
PGENESIS grant applications and use of PGENESIS on
PSC machines may be sent to <a href="mailto:pgenesis@psc.edu">pgenesis@psc.edu</a>.<br>

In your application for computing time, it will help the reviewers if
you include the following information:
<menu><li>What are the time and memory requirements for a single run
and
on
what hardware?
</li>
<li>If parameter estimation, what automated search technique(s) are you
using,
if any? Do you have an estimate of how many individual simulation runs
are needed for convergence?
</li>
<li>If a network model, what is the network structure (number of cells,
connectivity pattern, and number of compartments per cell). What
are the range of axonal delays, and what is the expected timestep size?
</li>
<li>Would you desire to scale this model up to even larger sizes than
can be simulated in reasonable time on current hardware?
