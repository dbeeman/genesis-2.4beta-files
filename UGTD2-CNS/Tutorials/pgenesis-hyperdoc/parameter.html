<p><b><font size="6">Parameter Searching</font></b> </p>
<hr>
<p>To do parameter searching one must first decide what parameters may
be adjusted, how the resultant network will be evaluated, and what
search method to employ to obtain the next set of parameters to try.
All of these decisions are very model-dependent, and will also be
influenced by the objectives of the researcher. It is beyond the scope
of this document to discuss the issues involved in doing parameter
searching, so we will concentrate on describing how one may use
PGENESIS to implement parameter searches. </p>
<p>Typically we will make one node a master node that directs the
search. The other worker nodes will each carry out simulations as
directed by the master. Each worker will also carry out an evaluation
of the simulation results (and this could be done either while the
simulation is running or immediately afterwards), The worker then
communicates the result of this evaluation (which often is just a
scalar "fitness" value, but not necessarily) back to the master. The
master uses this value in some way to choose the future parameter
values. Possible search techniques include genetic algorithm, simulated
annealing, gradient-descent, and Monte-Carlo methods. </p>
<p>Following this approach, the top-level script will look something
like this: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Every node will wait at a <a href="ref/barrierall.txt">barrierall</a>
for the entire set to start up. ("barrierall" is used instead of "<a
 href="ref/barrier.txt">barrier</a>" because each node is in a separate
zone<a href="ref/zone.txt">.</a>) </li>
  <li>Node 0 will act as a master and will execute the appropriate
search script. </li>
  <li>The remaining nodes will act as workers and wait at a barrierall.
While they are waiting at this barrierall, they will receive commands
from the master node directing them to perform simulations. When they
have finished a simulation and its evaluation, they will report the
result back to the master node by doing a <a href="ref/atsign.txt">remote
procedure call</a> on the master to record the evaluation result. </li>
  <li>When the master has completed the search, it will satisfy the
barrierall which the workers are waiting at, and all nodes will quit. </li>
</ol>
<p>To demonstrate a simple approach to doing a parameter search, we
have developed a <a href="skeleton_search.html">skeleton parameter
search example</a>. </p>
