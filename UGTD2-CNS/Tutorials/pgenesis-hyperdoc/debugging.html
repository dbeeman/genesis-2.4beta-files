<h3><a href="refman.html#gotchas">Common errors</a></h3>
<h3>Source Level Debugging</h3>
There is no source level debugging of Genesis scripts; instead, one can
set the <a href="ref/debug.txt">debug</a> level to provide more or
less detailed information about what is being executed in a Genesis
script. PGENESIS follows this model - a debug level can be specified in
the <a href="ref/paron.txt">paron</a> statement to control what level
of debugging information is printed out during a run.
<p>Currently it is possible to run the worker nodes inside their own
xterm window. This is achieved by providing the "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-debug tty</span>" flag to
the <a href="pgenesisscript.html">pgenesis</a> shell script which
controls how PGENESIS is run. In this case it is important that the
<a href="ref/paron.txt">paron</a> command in the GENESIS script
<b>not</b> be given the -output flag, which redirects worker output to
a file instead of stdout.</p>
<p>For those who need to debug C code (either GENESIS/PGENESIS source
code, or custom user-written libraries), it is also possible on some
platforms to run the workers and the
master under a C code source level debugger such as gdb or dbx. For
dbx the master and each worker run inside their own window, as for
the "<span style="font-family: monospace;">-debug tty</span>" option,
but each runs inside dbx. For gdb, the
master and each worker run inside their own window which is running
emacs, with gdb running inside emacs. These options are specified to
the <a href="pgenesisscript.html">pgenesis</a> shell script using
"<span style="font-family: monospace;">-debug dbx</span>" and "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">-debug gdb</span>" respectively.
</p>
<h3>Script modifications for debugging</h3>
In additon to adding more echo statements to the scripts, the following
ideas may be helpful.
<menu><li> <b>Timeout</b>
  <p>The timeout period is set by default to 120 seconds. You can
modify this with the command </p>
  <pre>       setfield /post msg_hang_time n<br></pre>
where n is the number of seconds to wait before timing out on
barriers, responses to remote commands, etc.
  <p></p>
</li>
<li><b>Barriers</b>
  <p>Many errors in parallel programming are due to incorrect
synchronization of the executing processes. Insertion of extra <a
 href="ref/barrier.txt">barrier</a> and <a href="ref/barrierall.txt">barrierall</a>
commands can help in
ensuring
that the synchronization you expect is in fact occuring. </p>
  <p></p>
</li>
<li><b>Asynchronous remote function calls</b>
  <p>Asynchronous function calls increase the potential degree of
parallelism in a parallel script, and therefore increase the risk of
deadlock (no process can continue because each is waiting for a
message from another) or other program error. If your scripts use the <a
 href="ref/async.txt">async</a> command, you can turn all these calls
into synchronous calls by globally replacing the string "async" with
"//async \<cr>", effectively commenting out the "async". </cr></p>
