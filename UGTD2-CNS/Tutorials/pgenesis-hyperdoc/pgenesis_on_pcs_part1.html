<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Using Parallel GENESIS on PCs with Multicore Processors</A></H1>

<P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
As computers are reaching the practical limit of CPU speed, it is becoming
more common to use multicore processors that effectively turn a PC into a
parallel computer.  As of mid-2008, it was possible to buy a PC with a quad
core CPU for under $1000, and eight core processors will be available in a
year or two.  This offers the prospect of harnessing this power by using
PGENESIS under Linux to turn an inexpensive PC into a fast parallel
computer for running large GENESIS simulations.

<P>
Parameter search and large network models are the most fruitful
applications of PGENESIS. (It is difficult to parallelize a
large hsolved single cell model, and a serial GENESIS is fast enough
on a modern PC to model single cells with thousands of compartments.)

<P>
For parameter searching, PGENESIS may not even be necessary.  Some degree
of parallelization is provided by the Linux kernel.  When there are four
CPU-intensive processes running on a four core PC (e.g. four GENESIS
simulations running at the same time), Linux will split the four processes
between the four cores and they will run in about the same time as one
process.  A parameter searching script that runs four separate GENESIS
simulations with different parameter sets at the same time will achieve
this efficiency.  The PGENESIS documentation also describes ways of
performing parameter searches with PGENESIS. 

<P>
There is nothing special that needs to be done in order to use PGENESIS
with multicore processors.  The intructions provided in the PGENESIS
documentation apply as well to these as parallel supercomputers and
clusters of ethernet-connected workstations.  This tutorial is intended
as supplementary material to guide you through this documentation and
to address specific issues encountered when using PGENESIS and MPI
on PCs with Linux.

<P>
The example described in Part 2 demonstrates how to convert a large
cortical network simulation (RSnet.g from the GENESIS Modeling Tutorial) to
a parallel version (par-RSnet.g) using PGENESIS.

<P>
<H2>Installation</H2>


<P>
These are the steps to install and test PGENESIS on a PC running Linux.
It is possible that they will apply to multicore Macs running OS/X,
but this has not been tested.

<OL>
 <LI>Obtain the latest PGENESIS


<P>
Download pgenesis-2.3.1-src.tar.gz from the GENESIS website
http://genesis-sim.org), or obtain them from a CDROM distribution of
GENESIS.  If GENESIS has not been installed, get genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz as
well.  If you do not plan to use MPI or XODUS graphics, you can use the
older pgenesis-2.3 version.  (This new version contains a replacement
version of pgenesis/src/par/pvm-emulation.c that is needed for it to
properly display XODUS graphics when it is run under MPI.)

<P>
Extract the pgenesis package with

<PRE>
    tar xvzf pgenesis-2.3-src.tar.gz
</PRE>
<P>
in the same place where you installed GENESIS.  For more details of the
installation process, or if you also need to install GENESIS, see
the instructions for installing GENESIS in the GENESIS distribution.

<P>
Extracting this, as described above, produces a genesis-2.3/pgenesis
directory; hence it should be extracted in the same place that you
extracted your genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz file. It will not affect your
existing genesis subdirectory, it will just add a pgenesis subdirectory
next to it. If you have already untarred it into a different place, you can
just use "mv" to move the pgenesis subdirectory (containing this README)
into the genesis-2.3 directory. 

<P>
<LI> Read the documentation provided with PGENESIS

<P>
The pgenesis/README file and the hypertext equivalent
pgenesis/Hyperdoc/index.html provide detailed instructions for installing
PGENESIS.  The following steps in this tutorial should be considered as
additional notes to supplement them.

<P>
<LI>Install LAM MPI 


<P>
PGENESIS adds a library (parlib) to an installed version of GENESIS,
creating an executable "pgenesis" that has the usual GENESIS objects and
commands, plus a "postmaster" object (post) and some other new objects and
commands.  The "postmaster" objects communicate with each other through a
standard interprocess communication library such as MPI or PVM that alllows
applications to be parallelized on any platform that can run MPI or PVM.
Before using PGENESIS, one of these must first be installed.  PVM is the
older protocol, and is gradually being replaced by MPI, which is somewhat
more efficient.  Therefore, this tutorial will emphasize the use of MPI.

<P>
There are several implementations of MPI available for Linux.
Unfortunately openmpi (http://www.open-mpi.org) does not work well with
curses, ncurses, readline, or other sophisticated I/O packages that
generally require direct control of the terminal.  This includes GENESIS,
and means that openmpi cannot be used with PGENESIS.  LAM is the most
widely available MPI application for Linux, and is the one used in this
tutorial.  It is possible (but unlikely) that LAM will already be
installed on your system.

<P>
You can test for the presence of LAM with "which lamboot" to see if
the program to start LAM (lamboot) is on your search path.  If LAM
was properly installed "recon", which is a test for LAM functionality
should tell you that all is well.

<P>
If LAM is not present, you may go to http://www.lam-mpi.org/ and download
the latest version of LAM, and then compile and install it according to the
instructions.  Alternatively, you can use a Linux package manager (e.g. yum
for Fedora, or apt for Debian and Ubuntu) to install the binary packages.

<P>
For Fedora, give the commands (as root user):

<PRE>
    yum install lam
</PRE>

<P>
This will also install lam-libs and some other dependencies.  Then
install the LAM development libraries with:

<PRE>
    yum install lam-devel
</PRE>

<P>
<LI>Edit pgenesis/Makefile
<P>

<P>
Following the intructions in README, copy Makefile.dist to Makefile
and make the required edits for your system.  In the case of Linux
and MPI, you will want to edit this section that starts with

<P>
# If you want to use MPI, uncomment and modify the following lines

<P>
After uncommenting them, you will have:

<P>

<PRE>
USE_MPI = 1
MPI_LIB =
#    set MPI_CMD to the command for starting an MPI job
#         you may use the following variables:
#            $$num_nodes  - number of nodes (processes) to start up
# $$config - configuration string given as "-config" parameter
#                              to pgenesis script
#            $$
#            $$exec       - name of the pgenesis executable
#            $$nargv      - arguments to the pgenesis executable
#         (remember to use $$ instead of $ or else "make" will treat
#          it as a variable to be immediately expanded)
<P>
MPI_CMD = 'mpirun -np $$num_nodes $$exec $$nargv'
MPI_DEBUG_CMD = 'mpirun -debugger gdb -np $$num_nodes $$exec $$nargv'
# # these last three are needed even with MPI to keep the scripts happy
PVM_ROOT = $(PWD)
PVM_ARCH = $(MACHINE)
SET_PVM_ARCH = $(PVM_ARCH)
# # remember also for MPI that you may need to change the compiler (CC) to
# #   mpicc (or something equivalent) in the machine-specific section of
# #   this Makefile
</PRE>
<P>
Note: The MPI_DEBUG_CMD above does not work with PGENESIS and LAM.

<P>
Further below, uncomment the Linux section, but using

<PRE>
    CC=mpicc
</PRE>
<P>
instead of

<P>
<PRE>
    CC=cc
</PRE>

<P>
Also add -DLInux to the line

<P>
<PRE>
    CFLAGS=-O2 -D__NO_MATH_INLINES
</PRE>
<P>
or  For 64-bit architectures, the line
<P>
<PRE>
    CFLAGS=-O2 -D__NO_MATH_INLINES -DLONGWORDS
</PRE>
<P>
Don't forget to uncomment the line
<P>
<PRE>
    # EDITED = yes
</PRE>
<P>
just before
<P>
<PRE>
    # END OF MAKEFILE CONFIGURATION DEFINITIONS
</PRE>

<P>
<LI> Make pgenesis or nxpgenesis

<P>
Be sure that GENESIS has been properly installed.  If in doubt,
repeat the procedure of "make" and "make install" in genesis/src, after
editing genesis/src/Makefile.  Then, in pgenesis/, do

<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>

<P>
Note that this performs both the compilation and installation step.  This
will compile PGENESIS linked with the Xodus libraries.  If you do not
intend to use graphics, you may still use genesis and pgenesis without any
significant performance penalty.  If you prefer to use pgenesis compiled
with nxgenesis, there is pitfall of which you should be aware.  In
principle, the libraries created in genesis/lib when installing GENESIS
without Xodus are just a subset of those created with Xodus.  However, one
file kinlib.o is different.  Also note that the PGENESIS nxinstall expects
to find ../genesis/src/nxliblist, which is produced by an install of
nxgenesis.  Therefore, you should first make the the non-Xodus version of
GENESIS with "make nxall" and "make nxinstall" (in genesis/src).  Then, in
the pgenesis directory perform

<P>
<PRE>
     make nxinstall
</PRE>

<P>
in order to compile and install pgenesis without Xodus.

<P>
<LI>Copy startup/.psimrc to your home directory, and be sure that .simrc and
.nxsimrc (if you use nxgenesis and nxpgenesis) are there also.

<P>
<LI> Set your search path to include /usr/local/genesis-2.3/pgenesis/bin, or
wherever you installed genesis and pgenesis.  (See genesis/src/README
or pgenesis/README for instructions on setting the path.j)

<P>
<LI> Start LAM

<P>
To see if LAM can be started, give the command

<P>
<PRE>
    recon
</PRE>

<P>
If lam was installed successfully, it will give an encouraging message.
Then you can start LAM with:

<P>
<PRE>
    lamboot
</PRE>

<P>
If LAM was just installed, you may need to open a new console window
so that the shell will find the newly insgalled files.

<P>
<LI> Test PGENESIS

<P>
Change to the pgenesis/Scripts directory and type:
<P>
<PRE>
    pgenesis -nodes 3 hello.g
</PRE>

<P>
Note that unlike the examples in Chapter 21 of the BoG, which were
based on using PGENESIS with PVM, you need to specify the number of
nodes to be used when using MPI.  The number of nodes does not
need to match the number of CPU cores.  MPI will allocate as many
nodes as specified, even on a single core CPU, although any nodes
in excess of the number of cores will have to share resources with
other nodes.

<P>
A successful run will produce the output:

<P>
<PRE>
Simulation Script:  hello.g
Simulation Script:  hello.g
Simulation Script:  hello.g
Initializing parallel library version 1.1.1.1
Initializing parallel library version 1.1.1.1
Initializing parallel library version 1.1.1.1
mynode = 0, totalnodes = 3, nnodes = 3
mynode = 2, totalnodes = 3, nnodes = 3
mynode = 1, totalnodes = 3, nnodes = 3
hello from node 0
hello from node 1
hello from node 2
</PRE>
</OL>

<P>
When you reach this stage, you are ready to begin Part 2 of this tutorial,
"How to convert large network simulations to use PGENESIS".  Look for this
soon on the GENESIS web site.
