<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>PGENESIS (Parallel GENESIS) is designed to allow researchers to run
simulations faster on parallel hardware; it supports both running
simulations of large networks on multiple processors, and running many
simulations concurrently (e.g. for parameter searching).&nbsp; PGENESIS
will also run on a single workstation and this can be useful for
testing.<br>
<br>
If you have a network model and want to use PGENESIS, you will have to
partition your model so that specific neurons are created on each of
the PGENESIS processes, and then connect them up using the PGENESIS<br>
raddmsg or rvolumeconnect script functions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with
PGENESIS 2.3 this is not automatic, although we hope to have resolved
this issue in a future version of GENESIS.&nbsp; Large single cell
models cannot be split across processes in PGENESIS 2.3, though, again,
this is an issue we are looking at for future versions of GENESIS.<br>
<br>
PGENESIS will run on almost any parallel cluster, SMP, supercomputer,
or network of workstations where MPI and/or PVM is supported, and on
which serial GENESIS itself is runnable.&nbsp; It is much easier to run
on<br>
a network of workstations if they have a shared file system so that any
workstation can access any file.&nbsp; If this is not the case, you
will need to install PGENESIS independently on each workstation and you
will need to have a copy of the files required by your simulation (data
files, script files, etc) on each workstation, preferably in an<br>
identically named directory path.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>COMPATIBILITY WITH REGULAR GENESIS</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>PGENESIS 2.3 is an update that has the changes needed to work with
GENESIS version 2.3.&nbsp; Older versions of PGENESIS will not work
with GENESIS 2.3 or later.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>HOW IT WORKS (IN A NUTSHELL)</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>PGENESIS adds a library (parlib) to an installed version of GENESIS,
creating an executable "pgenesis" that has the usual GENESIS objects
and commands, plus a "postmaster" object (post) and some other new
objects and commands.&nbsp; The "postmaster" objects communicate with
each other through a standard interprocess communication library such
as MPI or PVM.<br>
<br>
For more complete information on how to use PGENESIS, see the PGENESIS
webpage: <a href="http://www.psc.edu/Packages/PGENESIS">http://www.psc.edu/Packages/PGENESIS</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>INSTALLING PGENESIS</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<ol style="text-align: left;">
  <li>Download, compile, and install serial GENESIS version
2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have not obtained GENESIS already, download
genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz from either the GENESIS web or ftp site,
or copy it from the CDROM if you have a CDROM distribution.&nbsp; This is
a gzipped tar file which can be extracted with:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">cat genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz |
gunzip | tar -xvf -<br>
    </span><br>

This will produce a directory genesis-2.3/genesis.
Follow the instructions in genesis-2.3/genesis/src/README.&nbsp; Make
sure that after doing a "make" or "make nxall" you also do a "make
install" or "make nxinstall".<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Download and untar PGENESIS (which you probably have already done
if you are reading this).&nbsp; PGENESIS can also be downloaded from the
GENESIS web or ftp site, where you can get pgenesis-2.3-src.tar.gz.

Extracting this, as described above, produces a genesis-2.3/pgenesis directory;
hence it should be extracted in the same place that you extracted your
genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz file.&nbsp; It will not affect your existing genesis
subdirectory, it will just add a pgenesis subdirectory next to
it.&nbsp; If you have already extracted it into a different place, you
can just use "mv" to move the pgenesis subdirectory (containing this
README) into the genesis-2.3 directory.&nbsp; Henceforth we will refer
to the genesis-2.3/pgenesis subdirectory as ~pgenesis.<br>


    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure either MPI or PVM is installed.<br>
    <br>
Most clusters or parallel systems already have an installed MPI
implementation, so our recommendation is to use that.&nbsp; (You can
check if MPI is already there by typing "man MPI", "which mpirun", or
looking in typical locations where community software is installed,
e.g., /usr/lib/, /usr/local, /usr/local/packages/, /usr/share/,&nbsp;
/opt, etc.)&nbsp; Any MPI implementation that supports MPI version 1
functionality should work. In particular the MPICH and LAM
implementations are known to be compatible.&nbsp; If MPI does not
appear to be installed, ask your system administrator to install a
version appropriate for your system.<br>
    <br>
If, instead of MPI, you want to use an existing PVM installation, you
should have version 3.3.4 or later.&nbsp; If pvm is already on your
PATH you can find out the version number with:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">echo version | pvm</span><br>
    <br>
Make sure that your environment includes the proper settings for
$PVM_ROOT and $PVM_ARCH, and that the PVM object libraries are in&nbsp;
$PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH.<br>
    <br>
If you want to install PVM, you can get the latest version, as well as
more information about PVM from the PVM home page:<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html</a><br>
    <br>
You do not need the root password to install PVM.&nbsp; After untarring
the distribution, you will find installation instructions in
pvm3/Readme.&nbsp; A PVM manual is is also available from the PVM home
page.&nbsp; A PVM distribution and manual is also available from the
GENESIS ftp site, but it is not guaranteed to be the most recent
version.&nbsp; See the PVM document Readme.mp for more specific issues
about running PVM on multiprocessor machines.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Modify the Makefile.<br>
    <br>
The Makefile.dist file in the ~pgenesis directory should be copied to
Makefile, which should then be edited for your platform type as
described by the comments in the Makefile.&nbsp; Note that this is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
~pgenesis/src/Makefile, which should be left as is.&nbsp; For PVM, you
must set PVM_ROOT and PVM_ARCH in the Makefile, unless you have set
them in your .cshrc as described in the PVM manual.&nbsp; The default
setting for&nbsp; PVM_ARCH should be correct in almost all cases.&nbsp;
You will have to uncomment one of the machine/compiler dependent
options for CC, CPP, CFLAGS, LIBS, SYSLIBS, etc.&nbsp; The GENESIS and
INST_DIR macros should be set to, respectively, the full pathnames of
the serial GENESIS installation and the directory in which parallel
GENESIS should be installed (usually the PGENESIS root
directory).&nbsp; The PARSRC_DIR should be set to the full pathname of
~pgenesis.&nbsp; Finally, uncomment the EDITED=yes assignment; the
Makefile will not function until this is done.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Compile the parallel libraries and executables.<br>
    <br>
There are several Makefile targets available for compilation:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; 'make nxinstall'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - to compile and
install pgenesis without Xodus<br>
&nbsp; 'make install'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - to
compile and install pgenesis with Xodus<br>
&nbsp; 'make extended'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - to install
extended pgenesis with Xodus<br>
&nbsp; 'make nxextended'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - to install extended
pgenesis without Xodus<br>
&nbsp; 'make
env'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- to show some of the configuration settings<br>
&nbsp; 'make
clean'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - to
remove this machine type's object files<br>
&nbsp; 'make spotless'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - to remove
all machine types' object files<br>
    <br>
Normally, you will use the 'make install' command, which compiles and
installs PGENESIS with Xodus.&nbsp; Once the Makefile has been
customized, execute:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">make install<br>
    <br>
    </span>If you do not use Xodus, first make nxgenesis for serial
GENESIS, and then execute "make nxinstall".<br>
    <br>
If there are errors that are not ignored, then redo this command,
piping the output into a file and submit it as a bug report to
genesis@genesis-sim.org:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">make install &gt; &amp; !
make.out &amp;</span><br>
    <br>
&nbsp;(or for the Bourne shell: <span style="font-family: monospace;">make
install &gt; make.out 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</span> )<br>
    <br>
Note that, unlike the case with serial GENESIS, "make install" or "make
nxinstall" is used to both compile and install PGENESIS.<br>
    <br>
The compile process can be viewed by typing:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">tail -f make.out</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[ hit <span style="font-family: monospace;">^C</span> to exit the tail
]<br>
    <br>
Note that this is done in the pgenesis directory, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not</span> pgenesis/src.<br>
    <br>
Also note that, unlike the case with serial GENESIS, 'make install' or
'make nxinstall' is used to both compile and install PGENESIS.<br>
    <br>
This will create a shell script bin/pgenesis, which can be executed in
order to start PVM and run the proper pgenesis binary file.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The pgenesis binary is created in bin/&lt;arch&gt;, where &lt;arch&gt;
is one of the architectures&nbsp;&nbsp; supported by PVM (e.g. ALPHA,
LINUX, SGI5, SUN4, etc.)&nbsp; It will also create a .psimrc file that
should be copied to your home directory.<br>
    <br>
If you find that you need to make changes in the Makefile that are not
described in the Makefile.dist comments, or need to make other
corrections in order to install and run pgenesis, please report them to
us at <a href="mailto:pgenesis@psc.edu">pgenesis@psc.edu</a>.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>TESTING PGENESIS</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">After copying .simrc to your home
directory, set your path to include pgenesis/bin, in order to be able
to execute the pgenesis script from any directory.&nbsp; For example,
if the Makefile setting for PARSRC_DIR is /usr/local/pgenesis and your
shell is tcsh or csh, use:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set path = ($path
/usr/local/pgenesis/bin)<br>
<br>
If you are using bash as your shell, use<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pgenesis/bin<br>
<br>
You can do a simple test of PGENESIS by running the demo.g simulation
script in the pgenesis Scripts/orient1 directory.&nbsp; After changing
to this directory, start it with "pgenesis demo.g".&nbsp; This is a
3-way parallel decomposition of the genesis orient_tut simulation over
3 nodes.&nbsp; The default is to create these nodes on a single
processor.&nbsp; (Of course, to achieve any advantage of using
PGENESIS, you will want to use networked workstations or a multiple
processor machine.&nbsp; Details for doing this are given in the
documentation.)<br>
<br>
The display will be somewhat like the serial GENESIS orient_tut
simulation, and clicking on "sweep_horiz" should produce a similar
pattern of activity and plots.&nbsp; A log file is created in o.out, so
you will need to have write<br>
permission in the directory that contains this simulation.<br>
<br>
For an even simpler test, or for debugging, you can try Scripts/hello.g.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>RUNNING PGENESIS</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Each user should be make sure
that the PATH is set to include ~pgenesis/bin, where ~pgenesis is the
root of the PGENESIS installation, i.e., the INST_DIR variable in the
top level Makefile.&nbsp; If the script files you wish to use are not
in your home directory, the examples directory, or the directory in
which you run parallel GENESIS, you will need to add their directory
path to the SIMPATH variable in the .simrc file you use.&nbsp; By
default this is .psimrc for PGENESIS worker nodes.<br>
<br>
You can run PGENESIS by typing "<span style="font-family: monospace;">pgenesis
scriptfile</span>".&nbsp; This actually executes a <a
 href="pgenesisscript.html"><span style="font-family: monospace;">pgenesis</span>
shell script</a> rather than a binary executable.&nbsp; This shell
script performs checks and sets up necessary links before finally
running the binary <span style="font-family: monospace;">pgenesis</span>
(or <span style="font-family: monospace;">nxpgenesis</span>)
executable found in ~pgenesis/bin/$PVM_ARCH.<br>
<br>
There are several available options to the <a
 href="pgenesisscript.html"><span style="font-family: monospace;">pgenesis</span>
shell script</a>, which may be listed by typing
"<span style="font-family: monospace;">pgenesis -help</span>".&nbsp;
The most commonly used of these are:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-config &lt;file&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where &lt;file&gt;
is a file containing a list<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

see the <a href="pgenesisscript.html">documentation</a> for it.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>FURTHER DOCUMENTATION</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>For any use of PGENESIS beyond the simple test described below, see
the documentation in the Doc and Hyperdoc directories.&nbsp; You can
access the HTML documentation by pointing your browser at
Hyperdoc/welcome.html.&nbsp; The<br>
README.mp file gives instructions for use on multiprocessor
machines.&nbsp; The documentation also describes the use of PGENESIS on
a network of workstations.&nbsp; Please report any inaccuracies to
genesis@genesis-sim.org.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>DEBUGGING PGENESIS SCRIPTS</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>Normally the master node sends its output to your screen and the
worker nodes send their output to the file /tmp/pvml.???? on the
machine they are running on, where ???? is your uid on that
machine.&nbsp; Many script bugs can be tracked down by examining those
/tmp/pvml.???? files.&nbsp; Note that PVM appends to these files on
every run, until PVM is halted and restarted.&nbsp; Also note that if a
worker node exits without executing "paroff", some of its output to
stdout/stderr which is buffered may not appear in the /tmp/pvml.????
file.<br>
<br>
Output from the workers can be redirected to a file by giving the paron
command the -output &lt;filename&gt; option.&nbsp;
&lt;filename&gt; can be /dev/tty, in which case the worker output
appears on your screen mixed with the master's output.<br>
<br>
If you are running X-Windows, you can have each worker create its own
window and send its output there by using the "-debug tty" flag when
invoking PGENESIS.&nbsp; This requires that your DISPLAY environment
variable is set to "hostname:0" when you invoke the pgenesis script.<br>
<br>
By default PGENESIS starts the workers using -silent 3 which minimizes
the messages printed by the workers (e.g., the banner). To see more
worker status messages, give the paron command the -silent 0 option.<br>
<br>
Common errors include:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>User impatience leads to
interruption of PGENESIS before it
has completed the initialization of the workers.<br>
    <br>
The
timeout is set to 120 seconds, for maximum information about the
problem, let PGENESIS timeout if it fails to
initialize workers properly (i.e., wait!).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>PVM can't find the worker
executable.&nbsp; This is specified with the
-executable &lt;filename&gt; option of the paron command,
the default is "nxpgenesis".&nbsp; This executable, or a link
to it, should be in ~/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH.<br>
    <br>
A symptom
of this problem is that PGENESIS reports it failed to
spawn workers and the /tmp/pvml.??? files are empty
apart from the header.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>PVM aborts worker startup
due to I/O in your .cshrc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms
of this are that PGENESIS reports workers failed to
spawn and the /tmp/pvml.??? files contain error
messages about TTY or other strange things, and no GENESIS
startup banner.&nbsp; Modify your .cshrc as described
in pvm-cshrc.stub.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The workers can't find
the script containing the paron
command.&nbsp; Symptoms of this are that PGENESIS reports workers
failed to spawn and the /tmp/pvml.??? files show the
GENESIS prompt with no attempt to execute paron, or
the startup banners show that the script file could not
be found.&nbsp; Edit your ~/.psimrc and ~/.nxpsimrc so that
SIMPATH lists the directories containing the scripts.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Incorrect use of
barriers.&nbsp; Symptoms are that the master or some
worker(s) hang and eventually timeout.&nbsp; Examine your use
of barriers.&nbsp; Note that some commands contain implicit
barriers, it is possible there is a bug in the source
- if you suspect this mail pgenesis@psc.edu.<br>
  </li>

<h3>USER-EXTENDED PGENESIS</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">This section is intended for
GENESIS users who have written or are using custom GENESIS libraries
written in C that need to get compiled and
linked into the GENESIS executable.&nbsp; For PGENESIS libraries are
constructed just as for serial GENESIS, each in its own subdirectory in
a canonical form.&nbsp; See the GENESIS documentation for descriptions
of this
form.&nbsp; In this section we describe how to link these libraries
with PGENESIS components to create an extended PGENESIS.<br>
<p>Assuming your libraries are subdirectories of a root directory I'll
call MYPGEN, these are the steps you follow to create and run extended
PGENESIS:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy ~pgenesis/lib/Usermake to MYPGEN/Makefile.&nbsp;
Modify the Makefile for your platform type as described in the
Makefile.&nbsp; You must set PVM_ROOT and PVM_ARCH in the Makefile,
unless you
have set them in your .cshrc as described in the PVM manual.&nbsp; The
default setting for PVM_ARCH should be correct in almost all
cases.&nbsp; You
will have to uncomment one of the machine/compiler dependent options
for
CC, CPP, CFLAGS, LIBS, SYSLIBS, etc.&nbsp; The GENESIS and INST_DIR
macros should be set to, respectively, the full pathnames of the serial
GENESIS
installation and the directory in which parallel GENESIS should be
installed (usually the PGENESIS root directory).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Now add the names of your libraries and their
subdirectories to USERLIB and USERDIR and set the installation
root for your extended PGENESIS in USERINST.&nbsp; Execute<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; 'make
nxextended'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to make extended
PGENESIS without Xodus<br>
&nbsp; 'make
extended'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to make
extended PGENESIS with Xodus.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>This should create USERINST/bin and USERINST/lib
containing various files.&nbsp; The only one you need to be
aware of is USERINST/bin/pgenesis.&nbsp; To run your extended PGENESIS,
set your
path to include USERINST/bin early.&nbsp; Then invoke extended
PGENESIS with 'pgenesis' just as you would for vanilla PGENESIS.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>SYSTEM-SPECIFIC IDIOSYNCRACIES</h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p>When using PVM-based PGENESIS on various SMPs:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>On symmetric multiprocessors (e.g, Solaris multiprocessor,
SGI Challenge, DEC AXP/8k series) you may need to increase the number
of
shared memory segments and perhaps other parameters of the shared
memory
system to run PVM effectively.&nbsp; For example, on Solaris
multiprocessor, you need to add the following to /etc/system:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg = 100&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni = 100<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>On ALPHA and HP SMPs, we have found that PVM does not
always release the shared memory segments and semaphores it uses.&nbsp;
Unreleased items can use up all available shared memory/semaphore
resource.&nbsp; The script&nbsp; ~pgenesis/bin/ipclean attempts to
release these
resources.&nbsp; You can use the command "ipcs" to see the status of
the shared memory
system.&nbsp; In&nbsp; extreme cases a reboot is necessary to clean it
out.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>When using PVM-based PGENESIS on SGI/Cray Origin 2000:<br>
    <br>
There is a problem with PVM 3.4.beta3, PVM 3.3.11, and
probably earlier versions, in which the pvm_trecv call consumes
processor
time while it is waiting.&nbsp; The effect that this has is to cause
all
PGENESIS processes on the Origin 2000 to continuously consume cycles,
even if
they are waiting for messages to arrive from elsewhere.&nbsp; So, if
you
have more processes than processors, this will cause a significant
deterioration in
performance.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>When using PVM-based PGENESIS on DEC 8400:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
PVM appears to have problems in occasionally generating
unkillable processes.&nbsp; Machine reboot has been the only recourse
at times.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>On HPUX SMPs:<br>
    <br>
On HP-UX B.10.20 on an HP 9000/879 SMP, we found that
serial GENESIS must be compiled with bison/flex:<br>
    <br>
YACC = bison -y<br>
PARSER = bison<br>
LEX = flex -l<br>
LEXLIB = -lfl -lPW<br>
LIBS = $(LEXLIB) -lm<br>
    <br>
XINCLUDE=/usr/include/X11R6<br>
XLIB = /usr/lib/X11R6<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
