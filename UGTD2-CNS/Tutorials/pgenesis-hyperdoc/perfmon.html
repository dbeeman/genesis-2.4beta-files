<p><b><font size="6">Performance Monitoring in PGENESIS</font></b>
</p>
<hr>
<p>In PGENESIS 2.0 we provide a rudimentary performance monitoring
capability, which users can easily enable by including a couple of
accounting commands in their scripts.&nbsp; The monitoring package
tracks the amount of time spent in these
operations:
</p>
<menu><li>PGENESIS_PROCESS_SNDREC_SND - the time spent sending data to
other nodes
</li>
<li>PGENESIS_PROCESS_SNDREC_REC - the time spent receiving data from
other
nodes
</li>
<li>PGENESIS_PROCESS_SNDREC_GETFIELD - the time spent gathering local
data for
transmission to other nodes
</li>
<li>PGENESIS_PROCESS_SNDREC - the time spent in sending and receiving
data not
accounted for by the three preceding categories
</li>
<li>PGENESIS_PROCESS_SYNC - the time spent explicitly synchronizing
nodes prior to each step
</li>
<li>PGENESIS_PROCESS - the time spent in parallel overhead of
exchanging data
with other nodes which is not accounted for by the preceding categories
</li>
<li>PGENESIS_EVENT - the time spent handling incoming events i.e.,
spikes
</li>
<li>PGENESIS - the time spent in PGENESIS not accounted for by the
precding overhead categories. In other words the time spent doing
useful work.
[NB, this category currently includes time spent executing remote
commands,
including establishing remote messages, as well as all other work
associated
with constructing the model]
</li>
</menu>
<p> A script turns on this accounting with </p>
<blockquote><b>setfield
/post perfmon 1</b></blockquote>
and turns it off with
<blockquote><b>setfield /post perfmon 0</b></blockquote>
Whenever
performance monitoring is active, the categories listed above
accumulate time. So, to ignore the time involved in construction of a
model, do not activate performance monitoring until just prior to the
first simulation step.
<p> The accumulated time values can be dumped to file with the
command<br>
</p>
<blockquote><b>perfstats</b></blockquote>
This writes a
file to /tmp (usually a local disk) called
<b>pgenesis.ppp.nnn.acct</b> where ppp is the process id and nnn is
the node number. Each time <span style="font-weight: bold;">perfstats</span>
is called it dumps the
accumulated values, but it does not reset the accumulation bins.<br>
<br>
Advanced users can extend and customize this accounting by modifying
the
source C code of GENESIS, PGENESIS, and/or any custom user
libraries.&nbsp; See <span style="font-family: monospace;">src/par/acct.h</span>,
<span style="font-family: monospace;">src/par/libacct.c</span>, and the
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Acct()</span> calls in
<span style="font-family: monospace;">src/par/post.c</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">src/par/par_msg.c</span>.
