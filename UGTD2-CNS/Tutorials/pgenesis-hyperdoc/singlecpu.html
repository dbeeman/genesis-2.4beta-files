<p><b><font size="6">Interactive Single-CPU</font></b> </p>
<hr>
<p>We strongly recommend that you try your code first on a single CPU
with a minimum number of processes. For instance, if your decomposition
is <i>n</i>-way scalable, then perform your initial debugging with <i>n</i>
= 1. This will flush out many problems without the added complication
of parallelism. At this stage, small test cases are appropriate so that
running time is kept short to allow for interactive debugging. If you
have installed the Xodus-enabled PGENESIS executable (using "make
install"), then using graphical output can also be useful in ensuring
that your scripts are functioning correctly.</p>
<p>To try an example script: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Login to the host on which you will run PGENESIS (we assume here
that PGENESIS has already been installed). </li>
  <li>If you are working remotely using "ssh -X", sometimes you will
still need to give rights to the PGENESIS host to use your X-Windows
screen, (e.g. type "xhost +hostname" on your local console) and will
need to set the $DISPLAY environment variable on the remote host to the
"hostname:display_number" of your X-Windows display. If there is an
Internet firewall between you and the machines on which you are running
PGENESIS, you may need to talk to
your system administrator to enable you to use X-Windows remotely. </li>
  <li><tt>cd </tt>into the&nbsp; <tt>~pgenesis/Scripts/orient2 </tt>directory.
  </li>
  <li>For MPI-based PGENESIS, run "<tt><a href="pgenesisscript.html">pgenesis</a>
-nodes 3 1slice.g</tt>"; for PVM-based PGENESIS, run "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><a href="pgenesisscript.html">pgenesis</a>
1slice.g</span>".&nbsp; This will display all 3 neural populations in a
single window (the
chart graphs of Orient_tut are omitted for simplicity). Use the control
panel to run the simulation, by clicking on either the "sweep_horiz" or
"sweep_vert" buttons. </li>
  <li>When you are finished, click on the "quit" button and all
processes should exit. </li>
</ol>
<p>In our single slice case, there are actually 3 nodes, since 1 is
used for control and 1 for display in addition to the 1 handling the
single slice. Here we are running all 3 of these node processes on a
single CPU.&nbsp; See the web
page on <a href="orient2.html">orient2</a>
for additional details.
