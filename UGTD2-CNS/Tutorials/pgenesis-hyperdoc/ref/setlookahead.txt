Routine Name:	setlookahead

Description:	sets lookahead values for the current node.

Usage:		1. setlookahead <value>		use <value> for all nodes
		2. setlookahead <node> <value>  use <value> for <node>
		3. setlookahead			PGENESIS computes lookahead

Example:	setlookahead 0.01

			sets the lookahead for this node with respect to
			all other nodes to 10 msec.

		setlookahead 3 0.01

			sets the lookahead for this node with respect to
			node 3 to 10 msec.

Notes:		The third option (PGENESIS computes lookahead) is not
		yet implementd.
