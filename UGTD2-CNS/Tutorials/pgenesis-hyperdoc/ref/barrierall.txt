Routine:	barrierall

Description:	This function synchronizes all nodes in all zones.
		A node waits at the barrier until all the other nodes
		in all zones have called barrierall with the same
		barrier id.

		Every barrier has an id number, if no number is given
		the default is specified.  Barriers only match if the
		barrier id matches.  Valid id numbers are from 1 to 24.
		Providing barrier ids in a parallel script helps to
		verify program correctness (by causing deadlock for
		incorrect programs).  If no barrier ids are provided,
		then any barrier will match any other barrier in the
		script.  A timeout in seconds can be provided to barrierall
		commands, otherwise the default timeout value is used.

Usage:		barrierall [barrier_id [timeout_seconds]]

Example:	// wait at barrier 7 for a maximum of one hour
		barrierall 7 3600
