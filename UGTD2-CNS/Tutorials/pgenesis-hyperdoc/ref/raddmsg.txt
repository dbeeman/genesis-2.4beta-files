Routine Name:	raddmsg

Description:	Establishes message links between two elements.  The second
		element may be on a different node; the node would be specified
		using the '@' notation.

Usage:		raddmsg source-element dest-delement@dest-node-list msg-type [msg-fields]

Example:	raddmsg  /cell/dend /cell/soma      RAXIAL Ra previous_state
		raddmsg  /cell/soma /cell/dend@2    AXIAL  previous_state
		raddmsg  /cell/soma /graphs/Vmgraph@4,5 PLOT   Vm *voltage *red

Notes:		raddmsg sets up communication links to pass information
		between elements, possibly on different nodes.  Messages flow
		along message links created by the raddmsg routine each time
		a simulation timestep is executed.
