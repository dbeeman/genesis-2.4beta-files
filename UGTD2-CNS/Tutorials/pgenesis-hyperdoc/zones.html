<p>The two canonical simulation paradigms in PGENESIS are
</p>
<ol>
  <li>parallel - all nodes are synchronized by PGENESIS automatically
and </li>
  <li>farm - no nodes are synchronized by PGENESIS. </li>
</ol>
The former is useful for network simulations in which different parts
of the model running on different nodes must simulate in lockstep, or
close to lockstep. The latter is useful for parameter searching
applications in which the synchronization is explicitly performed by
scripts running on the nodes (e.g., all nodes execute a barrier).
<p>A third, hybrid, paradigm is embodied in the concept of
<b>zones</b>. Within a zone, nodes run in the parallel mode, with
PGENESIS performing automatic synchronization. The collection of zones
runs in farm mode - synchronization is controlled from the
scripts. This hybrid mode is useful for parameter searching on large
models in which each instance of the model can be parallelized across
a number of nodes. It may also be useful for a model of a system in
which individual components, simulated in a zone, need only loose
synchronization.
</p>
<p>Zones can be thought of as a partition of the parallel platform in
which no GENESIS messages can cross zone boundaries. Zones are
established by the <a href="ref/paron.txt">paron</a> command, and are
specified in other commands using the <a href="ref/atsign.txt">@</a>
construct.
