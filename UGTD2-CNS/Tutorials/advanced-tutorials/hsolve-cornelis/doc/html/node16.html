The <TT>chanmode</TT> Field: Modes of Operation</A>
</H1>

<P>
In the previous example we have seen a basic example of how to setup
<TT>hsolve</TT> and configure it to simulate a model represented by
two compartments.  How is this related to the mathematics we discussed
earlier on ?  Which numerical scheme was used for the cable equation
and which numerical scheme was used for channels ?  These questions
are answered by inspecting the <TT>chanmode</TT> field.  Basically you
have to make a major distinction between the lower chanmodes (chanmode
0 and 1) and the higher chanmodes (chanmode 2 to 5).  The lower
chanmodes are modes intended for compatibility with other Genesis
objects and they are slow compared to the higher chanmodes.
<TT>Hsolve</TT> will automatically update all the computed fields in
the original elements, such as to create the illusion that the
original elements still perform their own computations.  The updated
fields are then available for plotting or for other elements to do
additional calculations.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>chanmode 0 (default): <TT>hsolve</TT> computes the cable
  equation only (i.e. <TT>hsolve</TT> does the computations of the
  compartments).  All the other elements (Hodgkin-Huxley channels,
  concentration elements) still do their own calculations.  Since
  <TT>hsolve</TT> does not compute the channel equations, the channel
  rates are updated at time points independent of update times of the
  membrane potential.  This loss of second-order accuracy results in
  the penalty of having to use a small time step.

<P>
To communicate variables to/from other elements, <TT>hsolve</TT>
  uses the message system of Genesis.  This makes the chanmode 0 the
  most compatible mode of operation and it is recommended for people
  that have developed their own set of custom objects.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>chanmode 1: hsolve computes the cable equations and the
  <TT>tabchannel</TT> elements inside the compartments with a
  staggered time grid.  This results in some extra performance but is
  not completely compatible with all types of setup.  More precisely,
  incoming and outgoing messages for the tabulated channels are
  ignored, except for the messages that link the channels to the
  compartments (<TT>CHANNEL</TT>, <TT>VOLTAGE</TT>), single messages
  coming from a <TT>nernst</TT> element (<TT>EK</TT>) and a single
  message that is linked with the Z gate (<TT>CONCEN</TT>).  If your
  model contains only tabulated channels, all conductances will be
  calculated by <TT>hsolve</TT> at time points between the updates of
  the membrane potential.  This maintains the second-order accuracy
  and thus you can use a larger time step.

<P>
To use chanmode 1 in the previous example, you configure
  <TT>hsolve</TT> with the following command:

<P>
<PRE>
   genesis &gt; setfield solver path "../##[][TYPE=compartment]" chanmode 1
</PRE>

<TR><TD>
  <FONT SIZE="-1"><B>NOTE:</B> The compartmental <TT>Im</TT> field is only
    computed by <TT>hsolve</TT> running in chanmode 0 or 1 if you turn
    on the field '<TT>computeIm</TT>'.  Calculation of the <TT>Im</TT>
    field incurs a small performance penalty.

<P>
When using the higher chanmodes, <TT>hsolve</TT> will compile all
elements that belong to your model to byte-codes.  During the
simulation these byte-codes are emulated which results in a high
performance (the higher chanmodes can be 5-10 times faster than the
lower chanmodes, depending on the model structure).  To be able to
compile an element into byte-codes, <TT>hsolve</TT> must be aware of
the element type (the Genesis object) and its computations.  The
objects <TT>hsolve</TT> is able to compile to byte-codes, are
documented in the Genesis manuals.

<P>
The higher chanmodes all share the property that <TT>hsolve</TT>
computes all the elements present in your model on the staggered time
grid, so this guarantees second-order accuracy under all
circumstances.  A single time step in the simulation will compute the
membrane potential at the simulated time after an update of the
conductance at an intermediate time point.

<P>
In most cases the original elements' fields will not be updated.  For
<TT>hsolve</TT> the elements only serve as a description of the model
to be computed, so we call these elements <I>modeling elements</I>.
To inspect calculated values, they have to be fetched with the
<TT>findsolvefield</TT> command.  We will show examples of the use of
this command shortly.  The difference between the different chanmodes
lies in the fact that some fields might not be computed and are not
accessible - even with the <TT>findsolvefield</TT> command - as
explained in the following:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>chanmode 2: The compartmental voltage is stored in the
  respective fields of the original compartments.  Other fields like
  channel gates are accessible via the <TT>findsolvefield</TT> command.
  The channel parameters <TT>Gk</TT>, <TT>Ik</TT>, <TT>Ek</TT> and the
  compartmental membrane current <TT>Im</TT> are not stored by
  <TT>hsolve</TT>.  At every time step of the simulation,
  <TT>hsolve</TT> will update the membrane potential of the original
  compartments (that serve as the model) with the computed membrane
  potential.  If you are only interested in membrane potentials, this
  mode will be handy.  Outgoing messages to non computed elements that
  are created before the <TT>SETUP</TT> call are not supported in this
  mode.
</LI>
<LI>chanmode 3: This is exactly the same as chanmode 2, except
  that the compartments' <TT>Vm</TT> field is not updated.  The
  membrane potential is only accessible via the
  <TT>findsolvefield</TT> command.
</LI>
<LI>chanmode 4: As in chanmode 3, none of the fields of the
  modeling elements will be updated, but in this chanmode all fields
  are accessible with the <TT>findsolvefield</TT> command (including
  the channel parameters <TT>Gk</TT>, <TT>Ik</TT>, <TT>Ek</TT> and the
  compartmental <TT>Im</TT> field).
</LI>
<LI>chanmode 5: This chanmode is as chanmode 4 (all fields are
  stored), but the channel parameters <TT>Gk</TT>, <TT>Ik</TT> and
  <TT>Ek</TT> and the compartmental membrane current <TT>Im</TT> are
  calculated as relative values (normalized to the compartment
  surface).
</LI>
