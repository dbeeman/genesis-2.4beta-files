<b> Overview of This Document:</b> 
</center>
<HR>

<p>
This HOWTO is intended for users of the Genesis modeling system, to show how to couple
two or more cells via electrical synapses or "Gap Junctions", when the model cells have
been taken over by the Genesis Hsolver.  For models not using <b>hsolve</b>, there are
probably easier ways to implement gap junctions.  
<p>
This HOWTO may also serve as an introduction to the creation and use of Genesis "Extended
 Objects", since this is the method used here to implement the gap junctions.  For a 
different type of coupling, or for models not using <b>hsolve</b>, the basic structure 
used here could be copied, with just the commands inside the main function changed.
<p>
In addition, this HOWTO discusses potential instabilities that may arise with models having 
gap junctions, where they come from, and how to deal with them.  For some theory on Gap 
Junctions, and the implications for finite time-step modeling, see 
 <A HREF = "#GapJ_Theory">An Explanation of some properites of Gap Junctions</A>,

<A NAME="Important_Commands"></A>

<center>   
<b> Important Genesis Commands for Use With Hsolved Model Cells:</b> 
</center>
<HR>

<p>
Once a model cell has been taken over by the hsolver, reading and writing to
cell compartments is not a simple manner.  The three key commands to use to 
read and write to hsolved compartments are:

<A NAME="findsolvefield"></A>

<p>
1.) <b>findsolvefield</b>:  This command will return an address from the "chip array",
not an actual value. It seems general practice to read this chip address into a 
string called "hstr". For example, in the models used to develop the Gap 
Junction codes, to find the soma membrane voltage, one can use the command:

<pre>genesis #0 > hstr = {findsolvefield {cellpath} {cellpath}/soma Vm}</pre>

This will read the address into the string, but the actual value of "hstr" will be 
kind of meaningless:

<pre>
genesis #2 > echo {hstr}

vm[447]
</pre>

<A NAME="getfield"></A>

The actual value of the membrane potential can, however, be extracted with the 
second important command, <b>getfield</b>:
<p>
2.) <b>getfield</b>:  This command will extract the actual value from the chip 
array address found by the <b>findsolvefield</b> command.  With the example
above, the actual value of the membrane potential can be found with the following 
two commands: 

<pre>
genesis #4 > float Vm_Test ={getfield {cellpath} {hstr}}

genesis #5 > echo {Vm_Test}

-0.04801133517
</pre>

<A NAME="setfield"></A>

<p>
The <b>findsolvefield</b> and <b>getfield</b> commands are used to extract
information from the hsolve object.  In practice, though, one will want to extract 
these data, and then use them to calculate some quantity to be applied back to the
model cell(s).  This is accomplished with the <b>setfield</b> command.
<p>
3.) <b>setfield</b>:  This command can be used to set the value of one of the 
fields of a part of an hsolved object.  For this example, let us assume that some set 
of values, read in as above above, have been used to calculate the current that would flow
due to some model conductance.  Further, (for this example), assume that the compartment
we want to inject this calculated curent into is called "Comp_1".
<p>
The first thing to do is to find what the address of the "inject" field of this compartment is:

<pre>
genesis #6 > hstr = {findsolvefield {cellpath} {cellpath}/{Comp_1} inject}

genesis #7 > echo {hstr}

chip[2663]
</pre>

Again, the actual value of the hstr is irrelevant.
<p> To set the value of the injected current to "Comp_1" to 0.1 nA, we can use the commands:

<pre>
genesis #8 > float I_inj = 0.1e-9

genesis #9 > setfield {cellpath} {hstr} {I_inj}

OK
</pre>

<p>
With these three commands, <b>findsolvefield</b>, <b>getfield</b>, and 
<b>setfield</b>, one can, in principle, implement any type of conductance on or between
one or more hsolved objects.  In order to implement the "Gap Junction" electrical synapse,
they can be all put into an "extended object" that can be called in a run script, and
potentially implemented multiple times with multiple different properites.

<A NAME="Detailed_Instructions"></A>

<b> Detailed Instructions for Creating a Prototype Gap Junction 
Extended Object </b> 
</center>
<HR>

<p>
The rest of this HOWTO will concentrate on a particular implementation of an
hsolvable gap junction extended object.

<p>
This particular extended object has five "<b>fields</b>" one 
"<b>action</b>" and one "<b>process</b>".  
<p>For the complete implementation, see the
<A HREF = "#GapJ.g">GapJ.g</A> script. In the next few paragraphs, I'll try to 
go through that script to explain what its parts do.
<p>For an example of how to put copies 
of the Gap Junction object into a simulation, see the 
<A HREF = "#Gap_Junction_setup.g">Gap_Junction_setup.g</A> script, and the 
<A HREF = "#Gap_Junction_Run_Script_Calls">Run Script Calls</A>.
<p>

<A NAME="create"></A>

The <b>fields</b> in the Gap Junction extended object are the maximum 
conductance, the names of the two hsolve objects that contain the two 
coupled cells, and the compartment names of the pre- and post-synaptic 
compartments (which should be in different cells).  After the GapJ object 
is created with the 

<A NAME="addparts"></A>

<pre> create neutral /GapJ</pre>

command, the fields are defined with <b>addfield</b> commands, such as:

<pre> addfield /GapJ Gbar    // The Conductance of the Gap Junction</pre>

<p>
Next, the extended object needs to have an <b>action</b> and a <b>class</b>
 set up.  I'm not sure what these do, but the lines:

<pre>
addaction /GapJ PROCESS GapJPROCESS
addclass /GapJ device
</pre>

work to do the setup.
<p>
The <b>process</b> looks just like any other Genesis function, and indeed is
set up with the line:

<pre>function GapJPROCESS(action)</pre>

<A NAME="extracting_fields"></A>

<p>
The next bit is a little tricky, since even though the fields are defined in 
the prototype script, and set in the setup script, they are not directly 
available for use inside the process function.  For example, in order to get
and set fields in the two cells, new local variables must be defined inside the
function:

<pre>str Cell_1 = {getfield . Cell_1}</pre>

This line writes the string found in the local field "Cell_1" (that's what the "."
means) into the local variable of the same name.  Similar lines can be used to
copy all the local fields into local variables.

<A NAME="reading_in"></A>

<p>
Now that the function knows the names and values of all the relevant quantities, 
a series of <b>findsolvefield</b>, <b>getfield</b>, and <b>setfield</b> 
commands can be used to calculate the current that will flow in each time step.
<p>
As described above, the two commands:

<pre>
hstr ={findsolvefield {Cell_1} {Cell_1}/{Comp_1} Vm}  
           float V1 = {getfield {Cell_1} {hstr}}
</pre>

will copy the value of the membrane potential in "Comp_1" of "Cell_1" into the
local variable "V1".  The voltage of the other compartment in the other cell is 
found with a similar pair of commands.

<A NAME="calculating_currents"></A>

<p>
In actual cells, some gap junctions are "rectifying", meaning that their 
conductance will depend on the potential difference across the gap.  This can
be implemented by defining another local variable "<b>r</b>", with some pre-defined
dependance on the two voltages.  For a simple, non-rectifying gap junction, either 
eliminate the variable <b>r</b>, or set it to 1.
<p>
Next, the current that will flow in the next time step is calculated, following 
Ohm's law:

<pre>float I = {Gbar}*{r}*{{V2}-{V1}}</pre>

<A NAME="injecting_currents"></A>

The currents are then injected into the appropriate compartments with paired 
<b>findsolvefield</b> and <b>setfield</b> commands:

<pre>
hstr ={findsolvefield {Cell_1} {Cell_1}/{Comp_1} inject}  
            setfield {Cell_1} {hstr} {I}
</pre>

<b>NOTE:</b>  The currents injected into the two compartments should have 
<u>opposite signs</u>.

<A NAME="bookkeeping"></A>
<p>
That's it for the actual calculations; to finish setting up the process function, 
the lines:

<pre>
return 1
 end // of function GapJPROCESS
  // create the GapJ object
addobject GapJ GapJ -author "Carson B Roberts" \
   -description "hsolvable electrical synapse"
resched
</pre>

are necessary.  The last command, "<b>resched</b>" is called in order to reread 
the simulation schedule and schedule the listed element types for simulation.  
This is necessary bookkeeping for the extended object to be properly included 
in the simulation. 
<p>
With the <b>process</b> defined, it remains to create the prototype Gap Junction
extended object in the library.  A short function:

<pre>
function create_Gap_Junction
   ce /library
     if (!{exists Gap_Junction})
        create GapJ Gap_Junction
     end // of ifloop for creating GapJ.
end // of function create_Gap_Junction
</pre>

will create in the library a prototype "GapJ" object, named "Gap_Junction",
 if it has not already been done.  

<p>
From this point on, the Gap Junction object can be treated like any other 
Genesis object, such as a <b>synchan</b> or a <b>spikegen</b>. 
 Multiple copies of the prototype object can be made, and their properties 
set with <b>setfield</b> commands.  
An example of how this can be implemented can be found below, in 
the <A HREF = "#Gap_Junction_setup.g">Gap_Junction_setup.g</A> script. 

The basic set of commands to setup a functional copy of the prototype Gap Junction
object is:

<pre>
str GapJPath2 = "/inputs/GapJ2"
copy /library/Gap_Junction {GapJPath2}
setfield {GapJPath2} Cell_1 {cellpath}
setfield {GapJPath2} Cell_2 {cellpath2}
str GapJ2_compt1 = "p1[1]"
str GapJ2_compt2 = "p1[1]"
setfield {GapJPath2} Comp_1 {GapJ2_compt1}
setfield {GapJPath2} Comp_2 {GapJ2_compt2}
setfield {GapJPath2} Gbar {G_Gap}
</pre>

This block of code will create a Gap Junction object, named "GapJ2" in the
"/inputs/" element of the Genesis tree, connecting the "p1[1]" compartments of
the two hsolved cells with a conductance of "G_Gap" (defined elswhere).
<p>
This should be enough information to allow one to set up gap junctions between
hsolved cells.  One thing to be very careful of, though, is the relationship 
between the gap junction conductance and the integration timestep of the 
simulation.  The reasons for this are outlined 
<A HREF = "#GapJ_Theory">below</A>, along with some suggestions for appropriate 
values.
<p>
----Good Luck!!!!

<b> An Explanation of Some Properties of Gap Junctions </b> 
</center>
<HR>

<p>
One main difference between an electrical synapse or "Gap Junction" and a 
chemical synapse is that in the chemical synapse, the signal propagates 
from the pre-synaptic cell to the post-synaptic cell by a series of 
processes, each of which takes a finite amount of time.  When the action 
potential reaches the end of the pre-synaptic axon, first it triggers 
release of neurotransmitter chemicals from vesicles, then the neurotransmitter 
molecules must diffuse across the synaptic cleft to receptors on the 
post-synaptic cell.  

<p>
When the neurotransmitter molecules reach the post-synaptic cell, they must 
bind to ligand-gated ion channel molecules, and cause them to undergo some 
morphological transformation to allow ions to flow across the membrane.  
In general, after being activated, the receptor will inactivate (close) with 
some characteristic time constant.

<p>
In modeling, these various processes are often simulated with a "rise time" 
and a "fall time", as in the Genesis <b>synchan</b> object, with its 
"<b>tau1</b>" and "<b>tau2</b>" fields.  For most simulations, these time
 constants will be on the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> seconds or greater.  Thus, these 
processes will be slow compared to an integration timestep of 10<sup>-5</sup> seconds.

<p>
In contrast, the Gap junction channel is always open, and thus a current will begin
to flow across it as soon as there is any non-zero potential difference between the
two cells.  This is the equivalent of a synchan object with a <b>tau1</b> of zero.

<p>
One possible result of this is related to the fact that, at each time step, the 
current is calculated and sent across the gap junction.  Of course, the values 
are never exactly right, and so some will be a little high, and some a little low.  
This should be made up in the next time step.

<p>
However, the larger the time step, the larger the amount of charge transferred, 
which is equal to the calculated current times the timestep.  A larger change in 
charge means a larger change in voltage (Voltage is Charge divided by Capacitance).

<p>
This argument holds for the calculation errors in the Voltage as well,
and if this incorrect current is held on for too long, then the
resultant voltage  errors will be larger, in inverse proportion to the
size of the timestep.

<p>
However, If the size of the timestep is decreased as the gap junction conductance 
is increased, one can avoid the instability.

<p>

In the models in which this Gap Junction object was developed, I started with a 
timestep of 10<sup>-5</sup> seconds, which worked just fine for conductances of 
50 nS or less.  If I decreased the timestep to 10<sup>-8</sup> seconds, then I 
could get stable activity with a gap junction conductance of 50,000 nS, well 
above the biophysically reasonable range.
