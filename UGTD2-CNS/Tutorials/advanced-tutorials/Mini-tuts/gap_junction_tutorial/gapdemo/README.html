<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Demonstration of gap junction coupling</A></H1>

<P>
gapdemo.g is a simple demo of the effect of gap junctions on
synchronization of firing.  It is a modification of the
Tutorials/cells/simplecell simulation in the GENESIS Neural Modeling
Tutorials package, with two copies of the simple two-compartment cell
having a random background activation frequency for the dendrite
Ex_channel, and a gap junction between the the dendrites of the two cells.
The cells are defined in cell.p and protodefs.g.

<P>
The GUI allows the frequency and the resistance of the gap junction to be
varied.  The latter is performed by the function in graphics.g:

<PRE>
function set_R_gap(dialog)
    str dialog<BR>
    R_gap = {{getfield {dialog} value}*1e6}  // sets it globally
    // get rid of the original messages
    deletemsg /cell2/dend 0 -incoming -find /cell1/dend RAXIAL
    deletemsg /cell1/dend 0 -incoming -find /cell2/dend RAXIAL
    addmsg /cell1/dend /cell2/dend RAXIAL {R_gap} Vm
    addmsg /cell2/dend /cell1/dend RAXIAL {R_gap} Vm
end
</PRE>

<P>
With the default R_gap of 200 Mohm and a frequency of 200 Hz, the
synchronization is nearly perfect.  The firing begins to desynchronize
for larger values.

<P>
Of course, the synchronization is aided by the fact that the two cells are
identical, although they have independent set of random activations at the
same average frequency.  The setrandfield command can be used to the
genesis prompt in order to explore the effect of introducing random
variations in the cell passive parameters or the channel dynamics.  For
example:

<PRE>
setrandfield /cell1/soma Rm -gaussian 117891384 50e6
setrandfield /cell2/soma Rm -gaussian 117891384 50e6
</PRE>

<P>
This is causes some obvious decrease in synchronization when R_gap = 300 Mohm.
