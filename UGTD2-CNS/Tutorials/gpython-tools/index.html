<h1 class="title">GENESIS Python tools</h1>

<p>This directory (gpython-tools) contains a collection of stand-alone
Python-based graphical utilities for plotting, visualizing, and
analyzing the output of GENESIS 2 and GENESIS 3 (G-3) simulations.
There is nothing specific about GENESIS in these Python scripts, other
than the format of the plain text files that contain the simulation
output.  The scripts are well documented and commented, and may be
modified for use with other data.</p>
<p>They may be run from this directory with the sample data files, or
you may copy them to a directory on your search path (e.g. ~/bin or
/usr/local/bin).</p>
<p>These tools and files are described in the <a class="reference external" href="README.html">README file</a></p>
<div class="section" id="getting-started-with-python">
<h1>Getting started with Python</h1>
<p>The explanations of these example Python scripts assume a &quot;beginner's&quot;
knowledge of Python programming, equivalent to a weekend spent looking
through a book on introductory Python programming and experimenting
with the examples.  There are also many good tutorials and examples on
the web.  With this basic knowledge of Python syntax and what follows
in this tutorial, you should have the information you need to modify
these examples to create your own versions to do what you want.</p>
<p>Here are some useful links for learning how to program in Python:</p>
<p>The best entry point for finding Python tutorials at any level or
depth is the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide">Beginner's Guide to Python</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org">official Python documentation site</a> has
a well-organized index to the available documentation.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/">Python
Tutorial</a> is also a good starting
place.  Be sure to read the chapter on <em>Classes</em>, as most scripts that
are based on Matplotlib and other Python analysis and display libraries
use the object-oriented features of Python.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib web site</a> has a large collection of example
scripts with accompanying images of the results.</p>
<p>A short book on introductory Python programming that doesn't try to give
too much detail would be a good preparation for digging into more detailed
documentation from the web. At some point, you will want to consult the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/reference/">Python Language Reference</a>.  This
will be useful for looking up syntax that you don't understand in an
example.</p>
<p>Here is a list of software packages that should be installed in order to
use these scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Python (<a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">http://python.org</a>) will usually be installed by your operating
system package manager.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Matplotlib (<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib">http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib</a>) provides Matlab-like
functionality as Python functions and classes</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Scipy and Numpy (<a class="reference external" href="http://scipy.org/">http://scipy.org/</a>) provide scientific computing and
fast array manipulation routines.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">wxPython (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wxpython.org/">http://www.wxpython.org/</a>) implements the platform-independent
graphical wxWidgets set.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">IPython (<a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/">http://ipython.org/</a>) provides a better alternative to the standard
python shell, with many features such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>automatic history</li>
<li>very good built-in help</li>
<li>command completion</li>
<li>dynamic object introspection</li>
<li>integration with numerical and scientific computing tools</li>
<li>web notebook</li>
<li>can be used as a simulator shell (e.g. G-3, Topographica)</li>
<li>the '--pylab' option gives access to Scipy and Pylab</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IPython is not needed to run any of these scripts, but it is useful for
interactive development, debugging, and trying out ideas.</p>
<p>The packages above can usually be installed through the package manager
for your version of Linux, rather than downloaded through the links above.
However, these links are your first stop for documentation.</p>

<h1>Scripting examples</h1>
<p>The gpython-tools/examples directory contains some simple example
Python scripts and data files that were used in the January 2014
LASCON Python Tutorial.  They are described in the <a class="reference external" href="examples/README.html">README</a> file, along with suggested exercises.</p>
