Routine Name:	rotcoord

Description:	Rotates coordinates of elements in 3-D space.

Usage:		rotcoord path angle [-x | -y | -z | -axis x y z] [-center]
				    [-translatekids | -fixkids]

		path		path of element to be rotated

		angle		angle (in radians) for rotation

		-x		rotate about the x axis
		-y		rotate about the y axis
		-z		rotate about the z axis

		-axis x y z	use vector specified by x, y, z coordinates
				as the axis of rotation

		-center x y z   offset center of rotation (default: 0,0,0)

		-translatekids  have children of selected element translated
				parallel to the parent rather than rotated
				(default is to rotate)

		-fixkids	prevent children of selected elements
				from being moved

Example:	rotcoord /library/cell {-3.1415927/2} -y

Notes:		Note that the angle of rotation is in radians, clockwise
                about the specified axis.  By default, all the children of
                the selected element are rotated as well.  In the example,
                the original cell had the apical dendrite pointing along the
                x-axis.  This command will rotate it 90 degrees
                counterclockwise about the y-axis to point outward along the
                z-axis.  This is useful when using createmap or cellsheet to
                make a grid of cells having their dendrites normal to a
                surface.
