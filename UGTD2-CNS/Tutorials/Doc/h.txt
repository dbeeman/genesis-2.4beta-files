Routine Name:	h

Description:	Displays the contents of the command-history buffer.

Usage:		h
		h [start [end] ]

		start		number of first command to list (default: 1)

		end		number of last command to list (default:
				number of most recently issued command)

Example:	genesis > h 1 5
		     1    echo { x }
		     2    floatformat %0.5g
		     3    echo { x }
		     4    floatformat %2.5g
		     5    echo { x }

Notes:		Every command typed into the simulator at the keyboard is
		saved into a command buffer referred to as the 'history'.
		Commands saved in the history buffer can be re-executed using
		command recall mechanisms built into the script language.  The
		h routine displays the list of all commands in the range
		specified.  Typing h without any arguments will print the
		entire history buffer.  Typing h with a range will print all
		of the commands executed in the range specified.

		The following history recall functions are also built into the
		script language:

		Command   Example   Description
		--------------------------------------------------------------
		!!        !!        Re-execute last command.
		!n        !5        Re-execute the fifth command entered.
		!string   !echo     Re-execute the last command whose first
		                    chars match the string entered.
		ctrl-P    ctrl-P    Retrieve previous command in the history
		                    buffer. Repeat ctrl-P's to scan backwards
		                    through previous commands.
		ctrl-N    ctrl-N    Scan forward, after executing ctrl-P's,
                		    to echo next command.
