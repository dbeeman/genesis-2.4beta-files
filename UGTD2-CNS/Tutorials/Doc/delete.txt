Routine Name:	delete

Description:	Deletes an element and all of its children.

Usage:		delete  element

Example:	delete /neuron

Notes:		The delete routine is used to delete elements from the GENESIS
		element hierarchy.  Deleting an element which has children
		attached to it will also delete all of the child elements.

		In the course of deleting the object, the delete routine also
		issues the DELETE action for the object before it is
		eliminated.

                When deleting interpol_structs that share tables between them
                (e.g. tabchannel, tab2Dchannel, or tabcurrent), or the cells
                or compartments containing them, you must call TABDELETE
                first, in order to deallocate the memory for the tables.
                Finally, you have to give the "reclaim" command for the memory
                to actually be freed.  Note that the tables are shared among
                all copies of the interpol_struct that are created by copy or
                readcell from a prototype.  Therefore, you shouldn't call
                TABDELETE unless you plan to delete all copies of the
                interpol_struct.
