Routine Name:	ce

Description:	Changes the current working element.

Usage:		ce element-path

		element-path	complete or relative pathname of element to
				make current working element; can also be
				operating-system style hierarchy
				abbreviations, such as . (current),
				.. (element above current)

Example:	ce /
		ce /proto
		ce output
		ce ..

		genesis >  create compartment foo
		genesis >  ce ^
		genesis >  pwe
		/foo
	
Notes:		All GENESIS elements exist in a hierarchy.  The root element
		lives at the top of the tree (designated by /) and child
		elements are created beneath the root.  You use the ce routine
		to move about the tree (much as you can use the "cd" command
		to move about the operating system file system).

		If the element-path specified in a ce call starts with a /
		then the path is assumed to be an absolute path from the root
		of the element hierarchy.  If the first character of the path
		specified is not a / then the path is assumed to be relative
		to the current working element.
