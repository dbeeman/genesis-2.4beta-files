ELEMENT PARAMETERS

DataStructure:	xform_type [in src/Xodus/widg/xform_struct.h

Size:		124 bytes

Fields:		fg	Foreground color (not used)
		bg	Background color (not used)
		xgeom	Position of left edge of form with respect to screen.
			This value is an integer. If it is suffixed with a
			'%' symbol (eg set form xgeom 20%) then percent of
			screen size is used.
		ygeom	Position of upper edge of form with respect to screen.
		wgeom	Width of form
		hgeom	Height of form
			The geometry fields can optionally be set on the
			create line using the square brackets notation:
			[xgeom,ygeom,wgeom,hgeom]
		title	Optional text string to be placed on top of widget.
			Currently only available at create time.
		nested  Read-only flag that indicates if the form was created 
			as an embedded form or not. 
			(1 => embedded, 0 => top-level)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIMULATION PARAMETERS

Function:	XForm [in src/Xodus/widg/xform.c]

Classes:	widget

Actions:	XUPDATE: update internal fields when
			displayed widget is changed.

Messages:	none.
			
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:		Invisible until 'xshow' command is issued unless it is 
		created as an embedded form with the '-nested' option.
	
		One could also create an embedded form and 
		make it invisible by default using the '-noautomap' option
		in conjunction with the '-nested' option. For obvious 
		reasons, the '-noautomap' option is superfluous when used 
		with top-level forms.
		
		The xform does not perform any computational operations.

		Important: xforms are top-level unless created with the 
			   -nested option.

Example
		create xform /foo [0,0,500,50%] -title "I am a top-level form"
		xshow /foo

		create xform /foo/embedded_foo [0,0,100%,40%] -nested -title \
			"I am an embedded form" 

		create xform /foo/popup_foo [20,20:embedded_foo,,] -nested  \
			-noautomap -title "xshow/xhide to map/unmap me"
