Routine Name:	addglobal

Description:	Declares a global variable of the specified type, allowing the
		name of the global variable to be held in a string variable.

Usage:	        addglobal type name [value]
		type must be one of int, float or str.

Example:

		genesis > str name = "foo"
		genesis > addglobal float {name} 5.55
		genesis > listglobals
		float           foo = 5.55
		str             name = "foo"
		(plus many others)


Notes:

Often it is useful to use a string variable name to hold the name of a
global variable.  For example, one may want to pass the name of a global
variable to a function that declares a global variable, or that sets or
returns its value.  However, normal GENESIS syntax for declarations and
assignments does not permit a variable name to be specified by a string
variable.   The routines addglobal, getglobal, and setglobal are designed
to overcome this limitation.

Note that if addglobal is used within a function definition, the declared
variable will nevertheless be global, and not local to the function.
