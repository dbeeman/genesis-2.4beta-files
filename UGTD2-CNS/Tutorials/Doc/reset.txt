Routine Name:	reset

Description:	Resets simulation to initial conditions.

Usage:		reset

Example:	genesis > reset
		time = 0.000000 ; step = 0

Notes:		The reset routine returns the simulation state to its initial
		conditions (e.g., the simulation time is set back to 0) and
		invokes each enabled element with the RESET action in order
		for them to place themselves back in the initial condition
		state.  You should reset the simulation whenever you are
		getting ready to start a new simulation run, or after you
		adding new elements to the simulation.

		If the initial state of one element depends on the initial
                state of another element, you may need to call the RESET
                action for specific elements in the proper order -- the reset
                routine gives no control over the order in which the elements
                are RESET, and the simulator does not check for such
                dependencies.  (In most cases, you can issue two reset
                commands, instead.)

		For instance, the object which computes the Nernst equilibrium
		potential requires ionic concentrations. The initial potential
		therefore relies on the initial ionic concentrations. Thus the
		elements which compute the ionic concentrations must be reset
		before the elements which compute the concentration-dependent
		equilibrium potentials.  An example is given in nernst.txt.

		It is up to you to determine whether reset order is
		important.  Also, you should make sure that any objects you
		create document the conditions under which these
		dependencies arise.
