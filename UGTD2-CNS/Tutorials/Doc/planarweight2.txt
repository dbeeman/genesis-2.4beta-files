Routine Name:   planarweight2

Description:    

Description:    A faster version of planarweight, which sets the weight fields
                on groups of synapses between specified lists of elements.
                Most often used to set weights on groups of synapses that have
                been set up by calling the "planarconnect" command.  This
                function can assign groups of synapses to a fixed weight, can
                assign weights in proportion to the distances between pre- and
                postsynaptic elements, and can add various types of randomness
                to weight values.

Usage:          planarweight sourcepath destination_path   \
                -fixed weight                              \
                -decay decay_rate max_weight min_weight    \
                -uniform scale                             \
                -gaussian stdev maxdev                     \
                -exponential mid max                       \
                -absoluterandom

Notes:          In contrast to planarweight, which can set the weights of all
                efferent synapses from the source map when no destination is
                given, planarweight2 only sets the weights of the synapses
                from the source map to a particular destination map.  By
                requiring the destination parameter, planarweight2 achieves
                faster setup times than planarweight.  For further details of
                usage and examples, see the documentation for planarweight.
