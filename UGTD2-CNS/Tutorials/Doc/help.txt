Routine Name:	help

Description:	Displays help on GENESIS topics.

Usage:		help [ topic [help-directory-list] ]

		topic			string (typically a routine name)

		help-directory		list of directories containing
					ascii help files

Example:        genesis >  help CONTENTS | more
                genesis >  help synchan  | more
		genesis >  help myroutine /myhelpdirectory /basichelp

Notes:		Help searches specified help directories for documentation on
		the given topic (typically a routine name).  If no directory
		is specified then the current default help directory (the last
		help directory referenced) will be used.  If no default help
		directory exists (e.g., when help is used for the first time),
		the value of the environment variable GENESIS_HELP is used as
		the help directory (cf. setenv, getenv); this variable is
		set to the genesis/Doc directory, using the full path
                given in the default .simrc file.

                As most of these files are longer than a single screen, it is
                best to pipe the output into "more".

                If no topic is given, the genesis/Doc/README file is printed
                to the screen.   This gives further information about the
                current version of the one-line help, the GENESIS Reference
                Manual, and the hypertext documentation.

		[for help writers:]

		The Help facility allows text to be included from other files
		(use ## as first characters on a line, followed by the local
		file name; you can omit the .txt suffix).  For instance, you
		might create the following file trig.txt:

			TRIG Routines
			##cos
			##sin
			##tan

		When you type "help trig" to view this file, instead of seeing
		the text "##cos" etc., the contents of the file cos.txt would
		be read in and displayed at that point in the file.
