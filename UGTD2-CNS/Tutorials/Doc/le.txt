Routine Name:	le

Description:	Displays a list of elements in the element tree.

Usage:		le [path] -recursive -type

		path		pathname of element (default: current
				element);  path cannot include wildcards

		-r		recursively display entire tree starting
				at given element

		-t		display object type along with element name
				(type will be included in curly braces just
				after element name)

Example:	genesis > le / -t
		*proto {neutral} 	output {neutral}   
		cell/ {neutral} 	data/ {xform}   


		genesis > le / -r
		*proto 		output   
		cell/ 		data/   

		/cell:
		soma                                    

		/data:
		voltage/ 	RESET   
		RUN 		QUIT   

		/data/voltage:
		x_axis 		y_axis   
		title 		volts   
		current                                 


Notes:		Unlike the listings produced by the analogous operating-system
		command "ls", the listings produced by the le routine show
		elements not in alphabetical order, but in the order in which
		they were created.

		In the le listings, items preceded by an asterisk (e.g.,
		*proto) will not participate in simulations (see the enable
		and disable routines for control of this).
