Routine Name:	setmethod

Description:	Sets integration method for elements to use in simulation.

Usage:		setmethod [path] method

		path		path of element for which to set integration
				method (if omitted, specified method is
				applied to all elements in the simulation)

		method		integer identifying integration method to use:
				 -1  Forward Euler
				  0  Exponential Euler (default)
				  2  2nd order Adams-Bashforth predictor
				  3  3rd order Adams-Bashforth predictor
				  4  4th Adams-Bashforth predictor
				  5  5th order Adams-Bashforth predictor
				 10  Backward Euler
				 11  Crank-Nicholson

Example:	setmethod /cell/##[OBJECT=compartment] 2

Notes:		The method used is stored within the "object" data structure
		of the element.  For example:

		genesis > showfield /cell/soma object->method
		[ /cell/soma ]
		object->method       = 2

		The default Exponential Euler method is a good compromise
		between speed, accuracy and ease of use for network models
		and single cell models involving a few compartments.
		Multi-compartmental models result in numerically "stiff"
		equations which are best solved with one of the implicit
		(Backward Euler or Crank-Nicholson) methods.  The implicit
		methods must used in conjunction with the hsolve object,
		which takes over the computations of compartments,
		tabchannels and other selected element types.
