Routine Name:	resched

Description:	Assigns elements for simulation according to the
                current simulation schedule. 

Usage:		resched

Example:	[from startup/schedule.g:]

                deletetasks
                ...
                addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=device]      -action PROCESS
                addtask Simulate /##[CLASS=output]      -action PROCESS
                resched

Notes:		If you have created any new objects you want included in the
                current simulation schedule, you need to run resched so that
                the new object will be made known to the simulator.  This
                applies in particular to either compiled or extended objects
                that have an INIT or PROCESS action.   (However, the reset
                command also does an implicit resched.)

                In the example, all simulation events are removed from the
                schedule, and then new simulation tasks are listed in the
                schedule.  (Only the last two are shown here.)  Finally,
                resched is called in order to reread the simulation schedule
                and schedule the listed element types for simulation.
