Routine Name:	clearerrors

Description:	Resets error count to 0.

Usage:		clearerrors

Example:	clearerrors

Notes:		When the number of errors reaches its maximum value (default:
		10 syntax errors or 20 warnings) the current action is
		interrupted, the simulator goes back to the command line, and
		the errors are reset.  The clearerrors routine can be used to
		reset the error count before this occurs, allowing a
		simulation to continue running despite errors.
