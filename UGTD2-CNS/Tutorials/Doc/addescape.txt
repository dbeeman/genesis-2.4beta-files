Routine Name:	addescape

Description:	Adds an escape-key macro binding.

Usage:		addescape esc_sequence command-string [-execute] [-id string]

		esc_sequence		actual keystrokes (or representation)
					to associate with escape action

		command-string		string to insert in place when escape
					sequence is issued (should be in
					quotation marks if it contains blank
					spaces)

		-execute		flag to have command-string executed
					when escape sequence is called
					(this puts the field EXEC in the
					listescape table; if -exec is left
					out, default is REPLACE, i.e., insert
					command-string, unexecuted, in command
					line at point escape sequence is
					issued)

		-id string		label for this escape sequence, used
					typically to identify the escape
					sequence in user-understandable
					language

Example:	genesis >  addescape [15~ "/xproto" -id "F5"
		genesis >  le <F5>

		[line changes to:]

		genesis >  le /xproto
		/draw


		[associate command string 'echo "I am not a duck"' with key
		stroke sequence escape-a:]

		genesis >  addescape a "echo I am not a duck" -execute
		genesis >  <escape-a>
		I am not a duck

		[from escapelist.g file, included in startup:]

		addescape [A     <^P>                        -id "up arrow"
		addescape [B     <^N>                        -id "down arrow"
		addescape [C     <^F>                        -id "right arrow"
		addescape [D     <^H>                        -id "left arrow"
		addescape [1~    "execute movebol"   -exec   -id Find
		addescape [2~    <^I>                        -id "Insert Here"
		addescape [3~    <^D>                        -id Remove
		addescape [11~   stop                -exec   -id F1
		addescape [17~   "status -process"   -exec   -id F6
		addescape [18~   status              -exec   -id F7
		addescape [28~   "commands | more"   -exec   -id Help
		addescape [29~   step<CR>                    -id Do


Notes:		You use the addescape routine to create escape-key macros for
		commonly used command lines.  Here, the key is the key you
		will depress after the escape key, and command-string is the
		string which will be substituted into the SLI interpreter when
		the the escape sequence occurs.  (When the key is preceded by
		escape -- ctrl [ -- during keyboard input, the command-string
		is substituted.)

		A standard set of escape-key macros is specified during
		startup through the file escapelist.g.
