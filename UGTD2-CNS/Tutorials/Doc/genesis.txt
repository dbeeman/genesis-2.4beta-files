Routine Name:	genesis

Description:	Starts up the GENESIS program.  (operating system command)

Usage:		genesis [-usage][-nosimrc][-altsimrc filename][-notty][-nosig]
			[-execdir dirname][-nice nice-level][-nox]
			[-defaultcolor][-batch][script arg1 ...]

		-usage		print the usage message, listing options.
		-nosimrc	ignore the .simrc file
		-altsimrc	use 'filename' instead of the .simrc file
		-notty		do not accept terminal input
		-execdir	change to 'dirname' after starting genesis
		-nice		give genesis 'nice-level' priority
		-nox		start GENESIS without initializing XODUS
		-defaultcolor	use the display's default colormap
		-batch		run genesis in the background
		script		name of a GENESIS script to run

Example:	%  genesis -altsimrc ~/.backup_simrc

Notes:	When starting, GENESIS looks for an initialization file, .simrc,
	first in the current working directory, and then in your home
	directory.  After installing genesis, this file is created in the
	GENESIS installation directory.  After making any appropriate edits,
	you should copy it to your home directory and insure that the
	genesis executable is in your path.

	A new GENESIS command line option -defaultcolor will cause GENESIS
	to use the display's default colormap, even if the default visual is
	readonly.  The net result is that colorscale colors will be shared
	among multiple GENESIS processes, but GENESIS will fail to allocate
	a colorscale if the default colortable is full.  This option may be
	used to avoid X protocol errors on some SGI systems where the X11
	server defaults to a TrueColor (24 bit) visual.

        To perform a GENESIS simulation in the background (for example if you
        want to login from home over a modem, start a simulation, and logout
        while the simulation continues to run), your simulation script should
        use no graphics, and write all output to files.

        Besides specifying the -nox option when starting genesis to avoid
        starting XODUS, you also need to use the -notty and -batch options.
        GENESIS will attempt to read from stdin after the .simrc and command
        line script are completed.  The -batch option causes genesis to exit
        rather than try to read stdin.  -notty will avoid doing any terminal
        setup and cleanup procedures which can also cause this type of
        behaviour.  You must specify both on the command line (i.e. neither
        option implies the other).  In addition, you need to redirect output
        (both stdout and stderr) to a file.  For example, to run a script
        ``batchtest.g'' and direct startup messages and any error messages to
        a log file (using the C shell) you would use:

            genesis -nox -batch -notty batchtest >& batch.log &

        With the Bourne shell (or bash) it would be:

            genesis -nox -batch -notty batchtest > batch.log 2>&1 &
