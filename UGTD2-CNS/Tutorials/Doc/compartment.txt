Object Type:    compartment

Description:    Axially asymmetric compartment. Ra is located on
                one side of the compartment. This is slightly more
                computationally efficient than the symmetric counterpart.

Notes:          Simulates a section of passive membrane or cable. The
                potential across the membrane is given by Vm. There is a
                leakage path for current through the resistance Rm. This
                resistance is in series with a leakage battery Em. This
                compartment can be coupled to other compartments with an axial
                resistance Ra.  The compartment is not symmetrical, with Ra
                lumped to one side of the compartment.  Any number of ionic
                channels can be introduced into the membrane (Gk, Ek in the
                circuit diagram).  The membrane also allows current
                injection.

                The compartment Im is the sum of axial currents and injected
                current only.  The (transmembrane) channel currents or the
                leakage current are not included.  For a multicompartment
                cell, under a quasistatic approximation (C*dV/dt is small), Im
                is approximately equal to the sum of the channel and leakage
                currents, due to charge conservation.  This approximation is
                used in the efield object (see efield.txt) to allow Im to be
                used to calculate external field potentials.  The exception to
                this is when Im is calculated with hsolve in chanmode 4.  In
                that case, Im is directly calculated as the sum of the channel
                currents and leakage current though Rm.

                When a compartment performs its RESET action (usually
                invoked by the reset command), Vm is set to the value of the
                initVm field.  Normally, initVm follows any changes to Em,
                so Vm will be initialized to Em upon reset.  If, as in the
                Hodgkin-Huxley model, Em is a leakage potential that is
                different from the rest potential, initVm may be set to the
                rest potential.  It will then no longer follow Em, and Vm
                will be set to the rest potential upon reset.
                
                Calculates Vm using:
                
                    dVm/dt = {(Em - Vm)/Rm + SUM[(Ek - Vm)*Gk] + 
                        (Vm' - Vm)/Ra' + (Vm'' - Vm)/Ra + inject}/Cm

                In the diagram, the compartment shown in the middle
                receives the Vm' and Ra' of the upper compartment with
                an RAXIAL message, and the Vm'' of the lower compartment
                with an AXIAL message.  Channels deliver their Gk and Ek
                with a CHANNEL message.
