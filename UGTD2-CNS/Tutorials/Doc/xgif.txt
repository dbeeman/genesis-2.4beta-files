                script  Script operation(s) to perform on a mouse
                        click. The script calls of the pix are only made
                        if the draw determines that the pix is the nearest
                        to the event and if the event occurred within the
                        bounding region of the pix.

                        with the <v> or <value> argument.

                tx      Transposition distance in the x dimension. The
                        pix is transposed (ie, displaced, offset) by this
                        amount.
                ty      Transposition in y.
                tz      Transposition in z.

                        refreshes, mouse sensitivity and many other options.

                        currently supported.

Notes:          Unlike ximage, which displays a gif image in a form, xgif
                displays the image as a pix inside a draw widget.
