Routine Name:	disable

Description:	Disables an element and its children from participating in a
		simulation.

Usage:		disable  element

Example:	disable /prototypes/mitral_cell

Notes:		The specified elements are still accessible to basic
                operations such as setfield and showfield, but they will not
                participate in the simulation or be updated during the run of
                the simulation (i.e., when you use the step routine).

		You should run reset or resched after you disable an element
                to be sure that the simulation properly takes into account the
                disabling of the element.  (The resched command may be used to
                recompute the simulation schedule in order to remove the
                disabled element without resetting the simulation.  It is not
                a good idea to call resched frequently, especially for large
                simulations, as it does quite a bit of work.)

                The disable command cannot be used with script_out elements.
                If you need to disable a script_out element, it will be best
                to use a more versatile extended object, instead.  (See
                Extended.txt.)
