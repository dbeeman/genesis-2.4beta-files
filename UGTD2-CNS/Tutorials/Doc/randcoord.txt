Routine Name:	randcoord

Description:	Shuffles positions of compartments in a neuron.

Usage:		randcoord element fraction [-electrical] [-channel]

		element		name of element to shuffle

		fraction	fractional amount of shift

		-electrical	flag for scaling electrical properties with
				changes in length of compartment

		-channel	flag for scaling conductance of channels with
				changes in length of compartment (currently,
				only hh_channels and channelC2s are recognised)

Example:	randcoord /cell 0.1 -electrical

Notes:		Shuffles around the positions of compartments in a neuron,
		based on messages, to make the cell look more natural.  If the
                given element is not a compartment, it looks for children that
                are compartments without incoming AXIAL messages, i.e. somas.
                If the given element is a compartment, it starts the traversal
                at the compartment itself.  Having found the root elements, it
                then traverses them by their message trees, relatively
                positioning the children.
