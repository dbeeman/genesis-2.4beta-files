  6.  String Manipulation Routines

  The following table lists the basic GENESIS routines for working with
  text strings (i.e., variables declared as type str, or text enclosed
  in quotes).

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine      Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  chr          Returns ASCII character specified by number code.
  countchar    Counts occurrences of specified character in string.
  findchar     Returns location of specified character in a given string.
  strcat       Returns new string as concatenation of two strings. *
  strcmp       Compares two strings. **
  strlen       Returns length of string in number of characters.
  strncmp      Compares two strings up to specified number of characters. **
  strsub       Returns a string with one substring replaced by another.
  substring    Returns part of original string as new substring.

  * You can also concatenate strings using the GENESIS ``@'' operator.
  ** You can also compare strings using the GENESIS relational operators

  The getpath command with the -head and -tail options is often used
  with the commands listed above in order to get element names or
  partial path names.
