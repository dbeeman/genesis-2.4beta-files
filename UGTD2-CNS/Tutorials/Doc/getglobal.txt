Routine Name:	getglobal

Description:	Returns the value of a global variable, allowing the name of
		the global variable to be held in a string variable.

Usage:	        getglobal name

Example:

		genesis >  str variable = "EREST"
		genesis >  addglobal float {variable}
		genesis >  setglobal {variable} -0.07
		genesis >  echo {variable} = {getglobal {variable}}
		EREST = -0.070000

Notes:

Often it is useful to use a string variable name to hold the name of a
global variable.  For example, one may want to pass the name of a global
variable to a function that declares a global variable, or that sets or
returns its value.  However, normal GENESIS syntax for declarations and
assignments does not permit a variable name to be specified by a string
variable.   The routines addglobal, getglobal, and setglobal are designed
to overcome this limitation.
