Routine name:	swapdump

Description:	Mirrors initialization data for doing simulation dumps
		using simdump.  Consider this situation: we have a dumpfile
                that we want to read in, but at the same time we have
                laboriously defined (using simobjdump) our favourite sets of
                fields for all objects. Unfortunately the dumpfile has its own
                set of simobjdumps, which will overwrite ours. So we use
                swapdump, which puts our own simobjumps into storage, while we
                read in the dumpfile.  Then we can do swapdump again to go back
                to our original set of simobjdumps.

Usage:		swapdump

Example:	Complicated model is already set up, with its own preferences
		for simobjdump. Now we want to read in a dumpfile called foo.g.

		...
		swapdump // put original simobjdump preferences into storage
		include foo.g // read in dumpfile which has its own simobjdumps
		swapdump // restore original simobjdump preferences
		...
		simdump bar.g -all	// Save combined model using original
					// simobjdump preferences.
