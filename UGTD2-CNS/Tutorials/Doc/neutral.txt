Notes:		A set of default element types is distributed with GENESIS.
		One of the simplest is the "neutral" object which can be
		used to create an empty element used for grouping, much like
		a directory in the UNIX file system.  It is often used to
		represent a cell, containing subelements for compartments,
		channels, etc.  Although it has no other fields, it has the
		usual setable [x,y,z] coordinate fields possesed by other
		objects.  This allows it to be given a position in a network.

		The addfield, addaction, and addmsgdef commands can be used
		to give a neutral element new fields, actions, and messages,
		allowing it to be used as customizable element, or the basis
		of an extended object
