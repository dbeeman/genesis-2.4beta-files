Routine Name:	sh

Description:	Issues operating system command from GENESIS shell.

Usage:		sh command

Example:	genesis > echo hello there
		hello there
		genesis > sh echo hello there
		hello there
		genesis > echo $DISPLAY
		** Error - parse error
		genesis > sh echo $DISPLAY
		** Error - parse error
		genesis > sh "echo $DISPLAY"
		babel.bbb.edu:0
		genesis >

Notes:		You can issue most operating system commands just by typing
		them at the GENESIS prompt (if the GENESIS interpreter does
		not recognize them as GENESIS commands, it automatically
		passes them on to the operating system for evaluation).
		However, if you have a GENESIS routine with the same name as
		an operating system command, you need to use the sh routine to
		send the command directly to the operating system.
