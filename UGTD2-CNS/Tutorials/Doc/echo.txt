Routine Name:	echo

Description:	Prints out its arguments to the console.

Usage:		echo [arguments] [-nonewline] [-format format-string]

		arguments	strings, or expressions enclosed in braces

		-nonewline	do not include carriage return at end of line

		format-string	a string of the form "%[flag][width]s", where
				"width" is the minimum number of characters
				to be output.  If the output width is less
				than this, it is padded with blanks.  "flag"
				is as in C; "0" means pad with zeroes, "-"
				means left justify.  (to construct mixed
				formats, use multiple echo commands with
				-nonewline to place them on a single line)

Example:	
		genesis >  int five = 5
		genesis >  echo five
		five
		genesis > echo { five }
		5

		genesis > echo "Give me" -n; echo space! -f %20s
		Give me              space!

Notes:		The echo routine is used to print output to the command
		interpreter window.  If echo is followed by a string (or a
		quoted string) that string will be printed.  If echo is
		followed by a string enclosed in curly brackets, then the
		value assigned the variable named by the string will be
		printed.
