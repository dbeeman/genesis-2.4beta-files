Routine Name:       msgsubstitute

Description:        Allows undump of saved simulation with new message names

Usage:              msgsubstitute destobj orig_msg_type new_msg_type field1 ...

Example:            objsubstitute xplot fakeplot
                    msgsubstitute fakeplot PLOT INPUT .

                    also see Scripts/kinetikit/batch_interface.g

Notes:              msgsubstitute is used along with objsubstitute  to allow
                    you to save an object of one type using simobjdump and
                    simdump, and then use simundump to reload it as a
                    different type.  It allows for example, xgraph and xplot
                    elements to be saved as neutral and table elements, so
                    that the simulation can run in batch mode.  In the example
                    above, a real xplot object takes a PLOT message, but we
                    are using a table as fakeplot, which takes an INPUT
                    message.  Here, the "." represets the same field (the
                    data to be plotted) originally sent with the PLOT message.
