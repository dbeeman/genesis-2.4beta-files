Routine Name:	writecell

Description:	Writes parameters of neuron to a cell parameter file in a
		standard format.

Usage:		writecell filename cellname -cartesian -polar -relative
			-absolute -syndens -syncond -author author

		filename		name to give cell descriptor file
					(should end with extension .p)

		cellname		name of GENESIS cell for which you
					want to store description

		author			who made the cell

		default options		-cartesian -relative -syndens

Example:	writecell  newmitral.p  /mitral 

Notes:		This cell-writing routine is the counterpart of the readcell
		routine.  writecell takes a multicompartment neuron set up
		in GENESIS and writes it in the neuron descriptor format to
		a file.  Options allow you to specify whether the compartment
		coordinates are cartesion or polar, and whether they are
		given in absolute units or relative to the postion of the
		parent compartment.  The -syndens and -syncond options
		specify whether synaptic conductances are expressed as
		densities (conductance per unit area) or in absolute units.
		The format of the cell parameter file is described in the
		documentation for readcell.  The routine is capable of
		parsing GENESIS neurons which are not in the 'flat' element
		structure produced by the readcell routine.  There are
		limitations to the present version of writecell, as there
		have been new features added to readcell which have not yet
		been incorporated into writecell.  Thus, not all cell models
		can be parameterized with writecell.
