Routine Name:   volumedelay2

Description:    

Description:    A faster version of volumedelay, which sets the delay fields
                on groups of synapses between specified lists of elements.
                Most often used to set delays on groups of synapses that have
                been set up by calling the "volumeconnect" command.  This
                function can assign groups of synapses to a fixed delay, can
                assign delays in proportion to the distances between pre- and
                postsynaptic elements, and can add various types of randomness
                to delay values.

Usage:          volumedelay sourcepath destination_path   \
                -fixed delay                              \
                -radial conduction_velocity                \
                -add                                       \
                -uniform scale                             \
                -gaussian stdev maxdev                     \
                -exponential mid max                       \
                -absoluterandom

Notes:          In contrast to volumedelay, which can set the delays of all
                efferent synapses from the source map when no destination is
                given, volumedelay2 only sets the delays of the synapses
                from the source map to a particular destination map.  By
                requiring the destination parameter, volumedelay2 achieves
                faster setup times than volumedelay.  For further details of
                usage and examples, see the documentation for volumedelay.
