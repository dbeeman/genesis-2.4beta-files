Routine Name:	move

Description:	Moves an element and its children from one portion of the tree
		to another.

Usage:		move src_element dst_element

		src_element	element to move (if this element has
				sub-elements, they too are moved)
		
		dst_element	location into which to move src_element (if
				dst_element already exists, src_element is
				moved beneath it with original name; if
				dst_element does not exist, src_element is
				given that name as new name)

Example:	move /cell1 /cell5

		create neutral /network
		move /cell[1] /network

Notes:		In the example above, if /cell5 does not exist, /cell1 will
		be renamed to /cell5.  The second example turns /cell[1]
		into /network/cell[1].
