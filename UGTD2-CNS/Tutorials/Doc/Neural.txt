  12.  Neural Simulation Routines

  GENESIS offers many routines for working with components of neural
  simulation models.  The following tables summarize these routines:

  12.1.  Buffer Routines

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine        Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  clearbuffer     Removes events from the buffer of a buffer class element.
  getinput        Gets synaptic input to place in a buffer.
  putevent        Places events into the buffer of a buffer class element.

  12.2.  Compartment Routines

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine         Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  pastechannel    Copies a prototype channel to a compartment.
  randcomp        Randomly selects a compartment from tree root.
  randcoord       Shuffles positions of compartments in a neuron.
  relposition     Positions element and its child compartments based on
                  messages rather than parent-child relationships.

  12.3.  Miscellaneous Neural Routines

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine           Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  balanceEm         Adjusts Em field to give no net membrane current at given
                    voltage.
  calcCm            Calculates the approximate total membrane capacitance (Cm)
                    of a neuron.
  calcRm            Calculates input membrane resistance (Rm) of neuron.
  cellsheet         Copies prototype cells into a 3-d sheet specified by
                    coordinates in a file.
  createmap         Makes multiple copies of an element to form a2-D array.
  egg               Generates coordinates for points on the surface of an ovoid.
  plane             Generates 3-d coordinates for a plane with specified
                    dimensions and characteristics.
  rallcalcRm        Calculates input membrane resistance (Rm) of neuron,
                    using Rall's calculations.
  readcell          Constructs a cell from specifications in a cell
                    parameter file.
  setrandfield      Sets the specified field for the element randomly
                    according to specified distribution.
  setspatialfield   Sets the specified field for the element according to the
                    Gaussian of the distance between the specified coordinate
                    and element.
  writecell         Writes the specification of a cell to a cell
                    parameter file.
