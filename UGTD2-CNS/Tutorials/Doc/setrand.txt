Routine Name:   setrand

Description:    Selects Numerical Recipes or SPRNG random number generator

Usage:          setrand -nr -sprng

                -nr     Use the Numerical Recipes generator (default)
                -sprng  Use the SPRNG random number generator

Example:        genesis > setrand
                Using Numerical Recipes random number generator
                genesis > setrand -sprng
                Using SPRNG random number generator

Notes:

As of GENESIS version 2.2, SPRNG (the scalable portable random number
generator) has been incorporated into GENESIS to provide faster and higher
quality random numbers, which will be the same across all hardware platforms.
We continue to support use of the Numerical Recipes generator, which is used
by default.  In order to use the SPRNG generator, GENESIS must be compiled
with the appropriate lines uncommented in genesis/src/Makefile.  (This is done
by default, but the use of SPRNG may be disabled for some platforms on which
it refuses to compile.)  This allows you to choose among several algorithms
for random number generation.  Lagged Fibonacci is the default, as it is the
fastest and has the longest number sequence.

The setrand command is used to select between the NR or SPRNG generators.
When used with no options, setrand reports the currently used random number
generator.
