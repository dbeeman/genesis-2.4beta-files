Command Name:	addclass

Description:	Adds a new class to list of currently recognized GENESIS
		element classes.

		Adds a new class tag to a given element.

Usage:		addclass [element] class-name

Example:	addclass /sine device

Notes:		The addclass routine adds a class tag to a given element
		identifying it as belonging to the given class.  Omitting
		the element defines a class name without assigning any
		element to the class.  (This is a deprecated usage which
		may not be supported in future releases).

		Objects can be grouped into named classes.  This
		grouping can be used to facilitate the specification of
		operations to be performed on functionally related
		elements.  See scheduling (e.g., the addtask
		routine, and Schedules) for an example of class use.

		Classes are simply used for grouping of related
		elements and do not alter the element functionality in
		any way.  Classes in GENESIS don't carry the full
		connotations of classes within a true object-oriented
		programming environment.  They are simply convenient
		ways of creating named groupings to which objects can be
		assigned.
