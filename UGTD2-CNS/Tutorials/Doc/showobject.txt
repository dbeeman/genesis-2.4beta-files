		DESCRIPTION
			Axially asymmetric compartment. Ra is located on
		one side of the compartment. This is slightly more
		computationally efficient than the symmetric
		counterpart.
		genesis >

Notes:		This routine returns many pieces of information about the
		object type, including the class, size, author, valid actions
		and messages, and data fields with the default values which
		are assigned when the object is instantiated as an element.
		If the field is not readable and writeable, the field is
		labeled (ro) if it is protected as read-only, and (hidden) if 
		it and its contents are hidden to the user.
