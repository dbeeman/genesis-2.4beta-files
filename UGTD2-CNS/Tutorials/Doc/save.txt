Routine Name:	save

Description:	Saves current field values for specified element in a file. 

Usage:		save  path  file-name  -append

		path		pathname of element for which to save
				field values in file

		file-name		name of file in which to store field values

		-append		flag specifying that field values should
				be appended to file (if omitted, field
				values overwrite any existing values in file)

Example:	save /cell/## mycell.save
		reset  // (Or quit and restart genesis)
		restore mycell.save

Notes:		The save and restore commands are useful when you need to
		resume a long simulation at the point where you left off.
		However, some of the older simulation objects do not have
		the required SAVE2 action which is invoked with save.  (The
                showobject command will list the actions performed by an
                object.)  When using hsolve elements in chanmode 2 or 3, one
                must also call HSAVE and HRESTORE for the hsolve element.
