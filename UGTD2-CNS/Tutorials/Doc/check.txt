Routine Name:	check

Description:	Checks various aspects of simulation to catch specification
		errors.

Usage:		check

Example:	check

		genesis >  setfield /soma Rm -5000 Cm 0
		genesis >  check
		** Error - Compartment : Invalid Rm. '/soma'
		** Error - Compartment : Invalid Cm. '/soma'

Notes:		The check routine sends the CHECK action to the handlers for
		all enabled elements.  The CHECK action should verify the
		consistency and well being of the element and report any
		problems with it to the user.  (Each element which supports
		self-checking will be invoked with the CHECK action and report
		any problems.)

		In the example above, the CHECK action of the compartment
		checks to be sure that the Rm and Cm fields are set to
		positive values, and running a check prints an error message.
