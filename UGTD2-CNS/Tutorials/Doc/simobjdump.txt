Routine name:	simobjdump

Description:	Sets up the format for dumping and reading objects to a file
		using simdump.

Usage:		simobjdump object ... -coords -default -noDUMP
			
		object:  The name of the GENESIS object class

		... :    The fields to be dumped for this object

		-coords: Dump the x y z coords. 

		-default: Use all the fields defined for the object. This
			will also happen if you call simobjdump with no
			arguments, or if you don't call simobjdump at all.
		
		-noDUMP: A few GENESIS object classes, such as tables, have
			a DUMP action which does object-specific things.
			noDUMP inactivates this DUMP action. For example, in
			a table, the DUMP action would normally dump the entire
			contents of the table. noDUMP prevents this from 
			happening.

Example:	Here is a little dumpfile using simobjdump that recreates a
		simple 2-compartment model. In this case the simobjdump
		command was not used at all before the simdump, so the
		simdump command caused the entire set of fields for the
		relevent classes (neutrals and compartments) to be specified
		for the dumpfile.

		============================================================
		
Notes:		In theory it should be possible to use simdump on its own,
		without invoking simobjdump or initdump. In this situation, 
		the command assumes that all fields of the objects are to
		be dumped. This is inefficient. Worse, it causes problems
		because fields can take values that should not be reloaded
		into them. Pointers are a good example. Also see below about
		what happens with Xodus.

		Simdump will happily dump the entire contents of a 1-Megabyte
		xplot or table. This gives a valid, but enormous dumpfile.
		If this is not desirable, simobjdump allows one to specify
		the -noDUMP option.
