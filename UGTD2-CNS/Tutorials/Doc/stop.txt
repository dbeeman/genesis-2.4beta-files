Routine Name:	stop

Description:	Completes current simulation step, stopping simulation.

Usage:		stop

Example:	stop

Notes:		After cleanly stopping the simulation, the routine returns you
		to the GENESIS shell.  The stop routine is NOT equivalent to
		interrupting with ^C, which leaves the simulation in an
		unknown state -- stop completes the current step in progress.
