Routine Name:       objsubstitute

Description:        Allows undump of saved simulation with new object names

Usage:              objsubstitute orig_obj_name new_obj_name

Example:            create table fakeplot
                    // commands to add fields and actions to fakeplot
                    // to make it look like an xplot
                    ...
                    addobject fakeplot fakeplot
                    objsubstitute xplot fakeplot

                    see Scripts/kinetikit/batch_interface.g

Notes:              objsubstitute is used to allow you to save an object of
                    one type using simobjdump and simdump, and then use
                    simundump to reload it as a different type.  It allows for
                    example, xgraph and xplot elements to be saved as neutral
                    and table elements, so that the simulation can run in
                    batch mode.
