                             wildcards such as [] or #  (note,
                             however, that operating-system style
                             use of * is not supported)

                listname     The listname argument tells it to look for the
                             field <listname> on the element in <path> and
                             treat that as an element list.
Example:

                genesis > echo {el /#}
                /proto /output /cell /control /data

                genesis > echo {countelementlist /#}
                5

                genesis > echo {countelementlist /##}
