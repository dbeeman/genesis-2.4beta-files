Routine Name:	copy

Description:	Copies an element (and its children, if any) from one portion
		of the element tree to another.

Usage:		copy src-element dest-element -repeat # -autoindex

		src-element	element to copy (if this element has
				subelements, they too are copied)
		
		dst-element	location into which to copy src-element (if
				dst-element already exists, src-element is
				copied beneath it with original name; if
				dst-element does not exist, copy of
				src-element is given that name as new name)

		-repeat		is followed by an integer specifying how
				many duplicates of src-element to make

                -autoindex	automatically assigns the first free element
				index to the newly created element.

Example:	copy /cell1 /cell2

		// create 5 cells, cell[0-4]
		copy /library/protocell /cell[0] -repeat 5

Notes:		This routine copies an element and its children, without
		changing the original.

		Simulation messages and connections between elements within
		the copied subtree will be copied, but messages and
		connections to elements outside of the copied subtree will not
		be copied.

		After it has copied the object, the copy routine issues the
		COPY action for that element type, if any.
