Routine Name:	getenv

Description:	Returns value of operating-system environmental variable.

Usage:		str-value = {getenv environment-variable}

Example:	genesis >  echo { getenv DISPLAY }
		babel.bbb.edu:0

Notes:		This is a GENESIS implementation of the operating system
		printenv command, to have the value returned by the routine
		rather than displayed directly to the user.  (GENESIS also
		includes a version of printenv to have the value displayed
		directly to the user.)  The getenv routine allows the value of
		the particular operating system environmental variables to be
		used as a data value within GENESIS.
