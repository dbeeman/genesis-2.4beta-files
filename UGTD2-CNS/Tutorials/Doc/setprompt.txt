Routine Name:	setprompt

Description:	Sets string to use as prompt for GENESIS shell.

Usage:		setprompt prompt-string

		prompt-string	string to use as shell prompt (default:
				"genesis #!", where "!" is replaced by
				command number); if you want to use a string
				that includes blank spaces, you must include
				the prompt in quotation marks to make the
				string a single argument (additional
				arguments are ignored)

Example:	genesis #13 >  setprompt tutorial
		tutorial >  setprompt "tutorial !"
		tutorial 15 >

Notes:		When starting up GENESIS the command line will appear as a
		prompt waiting for user input.

		genesis #0 > 

		The number contained in the prompt refers to the index of the
		command which is incremented for each line entered from the
		keyboard. This number can be used in conjunction with the
		'history' recall mechanism to re-execute commands based on
		their index.  [Note that GENESIS starts with 0 rather than 1.]

		The prompt string displayed in the command interpreter window
		can be set using the setprompt routine.  Specific simulations
		often wish to change the prompt to reflect the nature of the
		simulation.
