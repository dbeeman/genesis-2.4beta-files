Notes:          Simulates electrical synaptic transmission designed
                specifically for leech HN cells, based on the synchan object.
		Needs presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane potential as
		input.  The output is the synaptic current that is added to
		the postsynaptic compartment via an inject message.  In
		addition, the pre- and postsynaptic membrane potentials can be
		lowpass filtered with an RC circuit.  The time contants can be
		set for both potentials. The synapse is unidirectional, that
		is, the current is injected into only the postsynaptic cell.
		To make a bidirectional synapse, another element must be
		created.  The synapse can be configured to be non-rectifying
		(passes both positive and negative current) or retifying
		(passes only either positive or negative current).  This is
		done by setting the rectify field to 0 for non-retifying, 1
		for passes positve current, or -1 for passes negative current.
