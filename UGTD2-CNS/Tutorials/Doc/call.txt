Routine Name:	call

Description:	Allows an element to execute the function associated with the
		named action.

Usage:		call path action [args...] -parent -virtual

-parent         call the action on the element using the parent object
                of the current object context as the new object
                context

-virtual        call the action on the element using the element's
                object as the object context during the action.


Example:	call /form/graph RESET
		call /form/graph/plot ADDPTS {x} {y}

Notes:		The call routine allows the user to send an action to an
		element's handler routine (outside of the simulation cycle).

		An action executes in the context of a specific object which
		is either the element's object or some base object for the
		element.  The object context determines what fields,
		actions, messages and classes are known and accessibility of
		fields during execution of the action function.  Without any
		other options to call, the object context during the call is
		the element's object or the current object context if the
		element is already executing an action.  The -parent and
		-virtual options modify this.  These options are to be used
		when an action is called within the function definition of
		an action to be added with the addaction command.  They have
		no affect when used outside an action function.
