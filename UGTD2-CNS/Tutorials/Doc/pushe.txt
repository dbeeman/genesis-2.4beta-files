Routine Name:	pushe

Description:	Saves current working element on stack (for later retrieval
		using pop), with option to go to new current working element.

Usage:		pushe [path]

		path		pathname of element to make new current
				working element (default: leave pushed
				element as current working element)

Example:	genesis >  ce /output
		genesis >  pushe /mitral
		/mitral
		genesis >  pwe
		/mitral
		genesis >  ce /
		genesis >  pope
		/output

Notes:		This routine ("push element") is analogous to the
		operating-system shell "pushd" feature for directories.

		pushe is used to change element to a new working element while
		saving the location of the current working element on a stack.
		The pope routine can then be used to return to the element path
		stored on the stack.
