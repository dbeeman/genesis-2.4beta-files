Routine Name:	el

Description:	Returns list of elements matching wildcard specification.

Usage:		list-of-elements = el path [-listname listname]

		list-of-elements	returned as a text 

		path			path specification, which may include
					wildcards such as [] or #  (note,
					however, that operating-system style
					use of * is not supported)

Example:	genesis >  echo {el /#}
		/proto /output 	/net

		genesis >  echo {el /net/neuron[]}
		/net/neuron /net/neuron[1] /net/neuron[2] /net/neuron[3]
		
		genesis >  str name
		genesis >  foreach name ({el /# })
		?  echo {name}
		?  end
		/proto
		/output
		/net

Notes:		In GENESIS 1, this was EL or element_list.  getelementlist
		is an alias for el in GENESIS 2.

		The listname argument tells it to look for the field
		<listname> on the element in <path> and treat that
		as an element list.
