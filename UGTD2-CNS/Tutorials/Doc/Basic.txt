  4.  Basic Routines

  The GENESIS shell provides a framework in which a simulation
  programmer can define and manipulate GENESIS elements.  But the shell
  also includes a number of generally useful routines.  The table below
  lists some of these routines.  (For more detailed descriptions of any
  GENESIS routine, refer to the reference section for the specific
  routine.)

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine       Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  addalias      Associates alternative name with existing GENESIS routine.
  addescape     Adds an escape-key macro binding.
  echo          Prints out its arguments to the console.
  exit          Exits from GENESIS, terminating any simulation in progress.
  h             Displays the contents of the command-history buffer.
  help          Displays help on GENESIS topics.
  listescape    Lists available escape-key/command-sequence bindings.
  quit          Alias for exit routine.
  setprompt     Sets string to use as prompt for GENESIS shell.
  version       Returns the version of GENESIS being used.

  The GENESIS routines used for interacting with the operating system
  include the following:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine    Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  cd         Changes current working operating system directory.
  cpu        Displays current cumulative cpu usage for user and system time.
  getdate    Returns operating system date-time.
  getenv     Returns value of operating-system environmental variable.
  printenv   Displays value of operating-system environmental variable.
  setenv     Set value of operating system environmental variable.
  sh         Issues operating system command from GENESIS shell.
  tset       A normal UNIX tset.

  The GENESIS routines used for adding new routines to the environment
  include the following:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine        Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  callfunc       Calls a function whose name is stored in a string variable.
  listcommands   Displays list of routines currently recognized by GENESIS.
  showcommand    Displays name of C function invoked by a GENESIS command.

  The GENESIS routines used for script programming include the
  following:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  Routine       Description
  ______________________________________________________________________
  addglobal     Declares a global variable; variable name may be a variable.
  argc          Returns argument count (number of arguments passed to the
                procedure).
  arglist       Converts list of items into an argument list.
  argv          Returns procedure arguments as an array of strings.
  clearerrors   Resets error count to 0.
  debug         Sets (or displays) the debug level used by some routines.
  debugfunc     Sets (or displays) the debug level for a specific routine.
  error         Print error message.
  getarg        Returns specified item from an argument list.
  getglobal     Returns global variable value; variable name may be a variable.
  include       In a script, reads in the contents of another GENESIS script.
  listglobals   Lists currently defined global variables and functions.
  maxerrors     Sets (or displays) number of errors currently allowed before
                a simulation is automatically stopped.
  maxwarnings   Sets (or displays) number of warning messages currently
                allowed before a simulation is automatically stopped.
  printargs     Displays its arguments with argument numbers.
  setglobal     Sets value of global variable; variable name may be a variable.
  silent        Sets/clears flag which supresses certain information
                displays to console.
  warning       Print warning message.
