Routine Name:	cd

Description:	Changes current working operating system directory.

Usage:		cd directory

Example:	genesis >  cd /usr/genesis/Scripts/neuron

Notes:		This is a GENESIS implementation of the operating system
		command cd, to assure that any change you make in the working
		directory is known to GENESIS.  (If you just issued a normal
		cd command directly, via "sh cd" for instance, the
		change in the current working directory would last only as
		long as the subshell created to enact the command, and future
		actions in GENESIS would not recognize a change.  The GENESIS
		implementation of cd fixes this.)
