Routine Name:	setfieldprot

Description:	Set the accessibility level element fields.

Usage:		setfieldprot element -readwrite fields ... -readonly fields ...
                    -hidden fields ...

		element		element for which to change field protections
	
		-readwrite	make the following fields readwrite

		-readonly	make the following fields readonly

		-hidden		make the following fields hidden

		-debug		turn on debugging mode; all hidden fields
				are treated as if they were readonly and
				any field may be made readwrite

		-nodebug	turn off debugging mode

Notes:		Hidden fields are not presented by showfield and are
		not readable in any way.  The presence of hidden fields
		may be determined using the showobject command.

		NOTE: The -debug option is intended to be used when
		debugging new objects.  Hidden and readonly fields
		should not usually be changed to readwrite as these
		fields are either private fields or computed by the
		object.  Setfieldprot will give a warning if a built in
		field is being made more accessible than the protection
		defined by the built in object.  If it is necessary to
		use debug mode to run a simulation please email the
		GENESIS development group and report the problem.
