Routine Name:	flushfile

Description:	The contents of a file opened with ``openfile <filename> w''
		and written with ``writefile <filename>'' are flushed from
		the buffer onto disk. The file remains open for further
		writefile operations.

Usage:		flushfile file-name

Example:

	genesis > openfile test w
	genesis > writefile test 1.0 2.0 3.0
	genesis > more test
	genesis >
	genesis > flushfile test
	genesis > more test
	1.0 2.0 3.0
	genesis > writefile test 4.0 5.0 6.0
	genesis > more test
	1.0 2.0 3.0
	genesis > closefile test
	genesis > more test
	1.0 2.0 3.0
	4.0 5.0 6.0


Notes:		This command is useful when the contents of a file need to
		be checked before a simulation has terminated. (Writefile
		alone does not flush the buffer, and file contents are only
		available after closefile has been issued).
