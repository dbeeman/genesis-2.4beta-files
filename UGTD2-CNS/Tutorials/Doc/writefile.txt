Routine Name:	writefile

Description:	Writes out ASCII data to currently opened file.

Usage:		writefile filename [arguments ...] [-nonewline] [-format str] 

		filename	name of file to write to (must first be opened
				with openfile routine with w or a switch)

		-nonewline	do not append carriage return at end of line
				(if omitted, carriage return is appended)

		-format str	use specified format string str to format each
				argument (to construct mixed formats, use
				multiple writefile calls with -n option to
				place them on a single line)

		arguments	strings to be written out to file (default is
				nothing, which effectively means a blank line
				unless -n is selected to suppress carriage
				return; the arguments are written out with
				single spaces between each and are terminated
				with a carriage return)

Example:	openfile test2 w
		// both of these write three entries per line,
		// each separated by a space
		writefile test2 1.0 2.0 3.0
		writefile test2 "4.0 5.0 6.0"

		genesis >  openfile test w
		genesis >  writefile test Vm = 10 "string   with space" {10+5}
		genesis >  writefile test  one -n
		genesis >  writefile test line
		genesis >  writefile test X Y -format "%5s"
		genesis >  writefile test 5.3 6.5 -format "(%3s)"
		genesis >  writefile test FIRST SECOND -n -format "%-10s"
		genesis >  writefile test  THIRD -format "%30s"
		genesis >  writefile test done
		genesis >  closefile test
		genesis >  more test
		Vm = 10 string   with space 15
		oneline
		    X    Y
		(5.3)(6.5)
		FIRST     SECOND                         THIRD
		done		
		genesis >

Notes:		The changes you make are made permanent when you close the
		file (using closefile), or flush the buffer with flushfile.

		There is limited formatting of output.
