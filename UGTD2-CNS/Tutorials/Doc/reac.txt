Object Type:	reac

Description:	Chemical reaction object. Works with pools to provide kf and
		kb. Reacs calculate the changes in concs for each pool hooked
		into them. The pool is responsible for adding up all the
		up and down changes resulting from various reactions it is
		involved in. Each reac can handle any number of substrates
		and products, though reactions of order greater than 2 are
		rare. Any number of reacs can be hooked up to a given pool.

		The generic reaction scheme is:
					kf
 		Substrate1 + S2 + ..  <----> Prd1 + Prd2 + ...
   					kb

ELEMENT PARAMETERS

DataStructure:	reac_type  [in src/kinetics/kin_struct.h]

Size:		bytes

Fields:		kf			Forward rate constant. Units depend
					on the order of the reaction, ie,
					the number of molecules on the
					left hand side. First
					order is sec^-1, second order is
					sec^-1.num^-1, etc.
		kb			Backward rate constant. Units depend
					on the number of molecules on the
					right hand side, in a similar way.
		A, B			Internal state variables, used to
					communicate with pools. A represents
					increase in the pool n, B is the
					decrease.
