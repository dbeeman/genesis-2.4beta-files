Routine Name:	deleteall

Description:	Deletes all existing elements.  [not recommended]

Usage:		deleteall -force

		-f		flag to force deletions

Example:	genesis > deleteall
		
		*** WARNING ***
		This function removes all elements from the simulation.
		If you really want to do this use 'deleteall -force'.

		usage: deleteall -force

		genesis > deleteall -f
		Simulator cleaned out.


Notes:		If no flags are specified, deleteall displays a warning
		message.

		The deleteall routine can be used to return the simulator to
		a startup state by deleting all existing elements, including
		elements which may be provided by default at startup.  If
		this is done, running the simulation scripts again could
		produce different results.

		If you really need to delete all the elements in your GENESIS
		session, you might as well quit exit from GENESIS completely
		and start again -- deleteall just deletes all the elements
		and might not reset other parameters to appropriate values.

		In general, you should not use the deleteall routine.
