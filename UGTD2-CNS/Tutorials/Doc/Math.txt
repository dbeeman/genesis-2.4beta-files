  5.  Math Routines

  The following table lists the mathematical routines available in
  GENESIS.  These routines include basic math, trigonometric, and random
  number routines.  (Remember that GENESIS also has standard arithmetic
  operators such as + for addition, - for subtraction, etc.)

  The GENESIS syntax for functions like ``exp'', ``sin'', etc. is a
  little unusual, as they take arguments that are separated by spaces,
  as with other GENESIS routines (commands) that have arguments.  They
  also require curly brackets (braces) to cause evaluation of the
  function and of strings that represent numerical quantities. Rather
  than the form exp(x), you would use {exp {x}}.  See the section on
  ``Using Variables'' in ``Creating Variables'' (Variables.txt) for a
  description of the use of braces with variable names.
