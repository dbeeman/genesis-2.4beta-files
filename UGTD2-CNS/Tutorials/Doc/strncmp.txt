Routine Name:	strncmp

Description:	Compares two strings up to specified number of characters.

Usage:		compare-flag = {strncmp s1 s2 n}

		compare-flag	returned as 0 if strings are identical;
				1 if s1 is "greater than" s2;
				-1 if s1 is "less than" s2

		n		number of characters up to which to make
				comparison

Example:	genesis >  echo { strncmp "hip" "hit" 2 }
		0
		genesis >  echo { strncmp "hip" "hit" 3 }
		-1

Notes:		The strncmp routine is like the strcmp routine, but restricted
		to a certain number of characters for comparison.

		"Greater than" means "later in the standard ASCII sequence".
