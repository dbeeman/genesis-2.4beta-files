Routine Name:	deletemsg

Description:	Deletes a message link between two elements.

Usage:		deletemsg element msg-number -incoming -outgoing
			-find srcelem type

		element		element receiving or sending the message

		msg-number	index of message in element message list
				(index can be obtained with 'showmsg'
				routine, or, in a script, with 'getmsg' used
				with the -find option)

		srcelem		element sending the message

		type		message type (PLOT, AXIAL, VOLTAGE, etc.)

		-incoming	message to be deleted is incoming

		-outgoing	message to be deleted is outgoing

		-find		delete the first message (lowest index)
				matching the srcelem and type

Example:	deletemsg /cell/soma 2 -incoming

		deletemsg /data/voltage -in 0 -find /cell/soma PLOT

Notes:		The deletemsg routine is used to remove messages added using
		the addmsg routine.  Deleting earlier messages will change
		the message numbers of the remaining messages.  If
		msg-number is not known for the desired message, it may be
		found by using getmsg with the -find option.

		When the -find option of deletemsg is used, the msg-number
		argument is required, but ignored, and the message must be
		an incoming one. (The -incoming and -outcoming options are
		ignored, if specified.)
