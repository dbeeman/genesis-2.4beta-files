Routine Name:	setglobal

Description:	Sets the value of a global variable, allowing the name of
		the global variable to be held in a string variable.

Usage:	        setglobal name value

Example:

float RM, RA, CM
create xform /control
create xdialog /control/RM  -value 1.0 -script "setglobal RM <value>"
create xdialog /control/RA  -value 0.1 -script "setglobal RA <value>"
create xdialog /control/CM  -value 0.01 -script "setglobal CM <value>"
xshow /control

Notes:

Often it is useful to use a string variable name to hold the name of a
global variable.  For example, one may want to pass the name of a global
variable to a function that declares a global variable, or that sets or
returns its value.  However, normal GENESIS syntax for declarations and
assignments does not permit a variable name to be specified by a string
variable.   The routines addglobal, getglobal, and setglobal are designed
to overcome this limitation.

The example above shows another use of setglobal to assign the value of
a global variable with the "script" field of an XODUS widget.  A normal
assignment statement would not work in this case.
