Routine Name:	setenv

Description:	Set value of operating system environmental variable.

Usage:		setenv environment-variable [new-value...]

Example:	genesis > setenv SIMPATH . ~/genesis/Scripts/neurokit
		SIMPATH=. ~/genesis/Scripts/neurokit

		[also see the GENESIS default .simrc file]

Notes:		This is a GENESIS implementation of the operating system
		command setenv, which lets you set the value of a particular
		operating system environmental variable.  Unlike its
		operating-system counterpart, setenv from within GENESIS
		requires that you supply a variable name (outside of GENESIS,
		setenv with no arguments displays the list of all your
		environmental variables).

		Unlike its operating system counterpart, setenv from within
		GENESIS displays the change that you make (outside of GENESIS,
		setenv just returns you to the prompt with no acknowledgement).

		The setenv routine is used most commonly from within GENESIS
		to define the DISPLAY and SIMPATH environment variables.
		DISPLAY determines the X11 host on which the display is made
		and SIMPATH lists the path which the simulator will search
		through for script files (cf. where).
