Routine Name:	egg

Description:	Generates coordinates for points on the surface of an ovoid.

Usage:		egg  filename  x  y  z  d  -normal

                filename        name for file into which to put generated
                                coordinates

		x, y, z		dimensions of the egg

		d		approximate distance between points

		-normal		"normal"; if selected, generates an
                                additional set of 3 coordinates per line,
                                to define the normal to the surface.  This
                                format is used by the cellsheet routine.

Example:	egg eggpoints 400e-6 400e-6 400e-6 100e-6 -normal

Notes:		Generates coordinates for points on the surface of an ovoid,
		(an egg) and puts them into a file, with an option for
                generating the normals at each point.  This is useful for
                generating layers of cells on an ovoid.  It tries to get
                fairly even spacing.  The coordinates are dumped into the
                file specified by filename with one set of coordinates per
                line.
