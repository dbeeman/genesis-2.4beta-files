Routine Name:	closefile

Description:	Closes an ASCII file opened with the openfile routine.

Usage:		closefile filename

Example:	openfile myfile w
		writefile myfile 10 20 30
		closefile myfile

Notes:		When you open a file using openfile, you work on a copy of
		the file.  The closefile routine writes your changes back
		into the actual file and eliminates it from the list of open
		files.  (Closefile is automatically called for all opened
		files when you exit from GENESIS).
