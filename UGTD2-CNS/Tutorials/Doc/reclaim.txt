Routine Name:	reclaim

Description:	Reclaims memory from deleted elements

Usage:		reclaim

Example:        call Na_hh_tchan TABDELETE
                delete Na_hh_tchan
                reclaim

Notes:		Memory from deleted elements is usually freed when the
		simulator returns to the command prompt.  When running
		in batch mode in situations where many elements are being
		created and deleted, it may be necessary to use reclaim
		to free the memory from deleted elements.

                At present, elements containing interpol_structs (tables) do
                not free up the memory allocated to the tables, when they are
                deleted.  Objects that have a TABDELETE action (e.g.
                tabchannels) will deallocate this memory, if TABDELETE is
                called before the element is deleted.  Finally, you have to
                give the reclaim command for the memory to actually be freed.

                Note that the tables are shared among all tabchannels that are
                created by copy or readcell from a prototype.  Therefore, you
                shouldn't call TABDELETE unless you plan to delete all copies
                of the channel.

		Care should be taken to ensure that deleted elements
		will not be actively executing after reclaim is
		called.  This should only be a potential problem within
		an extended object action function or a widget callback
		script.  Also, it should be noted that reclaim will
		recompute the simulation schedule which could be time
		consuming.
