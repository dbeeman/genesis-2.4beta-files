<H1>Making synaptic connections</H1>

<H2>Adding synapses and providing synaptic input</H2>

<P>
We have already added an exitatory and an inhibitory synaptically activated
channel to the <i>/cell/dend</i> compartment, and a <i>spike</i> element to the
soma, but haven't yet made any use of them.

<P>
Usually, we can treat an axon as a simple delay line for the delivery of
spike events that last a single time step.  Only if we are interested in
understanding the details of axonal propagation would it be necessary to
model the axon as a series of linked compartments.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><img src="images/syn-connect.gif">

<P>
The properties of an axon are split between two types of GENESIS objects.
Spiking class objects (<b>spikegen</b> or <b>randomspike</b>) create the
spike events, either when Vm crosses a threshold during an action potential
(<b>spikegen</b>), or as a random series of events generated at a specified
average rate (<b>randomspike</b>).  These send SPIKE messages to a synchannel
class element (<b>synchan</b>, <b>hebbsynchan</b>, or <b>facsynchan</b>),
which contains fields for the propagation delays and synaptic weighting for
each synaptic connection.

<P>
For example, to send somatic action potentials in cell1 to a <b>synchan</b>
element <i>Ex_channel</i> in the dendrite compartment of <i>cell2</i>, you
might use:

<PRE>
  create spikegen /cell1/soma/spike
  setfield /cell1/soma/spike thresh 0 abs_refract 0.005 output_amp 1
  addmsg  /cell1/soma  /cell1/soma/spike  INPUT Vm

  addmsg /cell1/soma/spike /cell2/dend/Ex_channel SPIKE
  setfield /cell2/dend/Ex_channel synapse[0].weight 10 synapse[0].delay 0.005
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, a spike is generated by the <i>spikegen</i> when the soma Vm
exceeds the threshold value of 0.  
<P>

The field 'abs_refract' has been set to 0.005 (5 msec) in order to prevent
multiple spikes from being generated during the time that Vm is above
threshold.  Normally, abs_refract will be set to something greater than the
maximum width of the action potential at threshold, and less than the
minimum expected interspike interval.  Note that the true absolute
refractory period of a neuron is determined by the dynamics of the
conductances that produce the action potentials.  The abs_refract field of
a <b>spikegen</b> would only be used to set an absolute refractory period for
firing when using highly simplified neuron models, or artificial inputs
that need to generate spikes with a specified minimum period.

<P>
Each time a new SPIKE message is added, it creates a new synapse
within the <b>synchan</b>.  Here, this synaptic connection is labeled as
"synapse[0]", as it was the first (of possibly several) to be established
with the SPIKE message.


<P>
In order to understand more about the use of these synaptically activated
channels, you will need to read the documentation for
Synaptic Connections in the <A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">
GENESIS Reference Manual</A>, and the documentation for
<a href="textDoc/synchan.doc.txt">synchan</a>,
<a href="textDoc/spikegen.doc.txt">spikegen</a>, and
<a href="textDoc/randomspike.doc.txt">randomspike</a>.
It will also be helpful to look at <a href=
"textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/synchans.g.txt"><i>
genesis/Scripts/neurokit/prototypes/synchans.g</i></a> in order to
understand the properties of the channels <i>Ex_channel</i> and
<i>Inh_channel</i> in <i>/cell/dend</i>.

The WAM-BAMM 2005 <A HREF="../advanced-tutorials/index.html">Advanced Tutorial</A>
"Simulating in vivo-like synaptic input patterns in multicompartmental models"
(Edgerton, 2005) describes how realistic spike trains can be generated as
probability distributions, or read from experimental data.  The
electronically published version may be viewed at
<A HREF="http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/225">
http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/225</A>.


<P>
Then, try this simple exercise:

<P>
Modify the <i>simplecell.g</i> script to add a randomspike element with an
average spike rate of 200 spikes per second.  Connect it to
<i>/cell/dend/Ex_channel</i>, and set the soma current injection to zero.
If you would like to play with XODUS graphics some more, plot the
<i>Ex_channel</i> conductance Gk on another graph.

<P>
If you get stuck, look at <a href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial4.g.txt">
tutorial4.g</a> ("the hard way") or <a
href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial5.g.txt">tutorial5.g</a> (with
<i>readcell</i>).  In addition to the random spike input, these scripts
illustrate the coupling of a cell's spike output to a <i>synchan</i>, by
providing a feedback connection from the cell to itself.
Chapter 15 of the <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> gives a detailed
description of the steps in the construction of <i>tutorial4.g</i>.

<P>
Once you feel that you are ready, continue to the next section of this
tutorial.  This provides a more realistic exercise that connects two cells to
each other to form a pattern generator circuit.

<H2>Building small networks and circuits</H2>

<P>
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple network of two cells that
fire in alternate bursts.  This will be made from two cells derived from
the one created in the simplecell simulation, called <i>/cell1</i> and
<i>/cell2</i>.  After you feel that you understand <i>simplecell.g</i> and
its included files, and have studied the documentation on the use of the
<i>synchan</i> and <i>spikegen</i> objects, copy the
<i>cells/simplecell</i> files into a directory of your own.  Then, make the
changes necessary to create a second cell with no current injection, and
plot its Vm on the graph in a different color.  Of course, the plot will be
a flat line, as it is receiving no stimulus.

<P>
Then, use what you have learned about synaptic connections to connect the
<i>spike</i> output of <i>cell1</i> to the excitatory <b>synchan</b> of
<i>cell2</i>, and the <i>spike</i> output of <i>cell2</i> to the inhibitory
input of <i>cell1</i>.  Use an axonal propagation delay of 0.005 seconds
for each connection.  Finally, experiment with the synaptic weights for
each synapse until you can achieve a pattern of alternate bursts of action
potentials.  To make it easy to change the weights, you may wish to add
dialog boxes for entering weights to the control panel.

<P> Gap junctions provide another way that neurons can interact, but
without chemical synapses. The exercise in
<A HREF="../exercises/gap_junctions/README.html">exercises/gap_junctions</A>
suggests how you might add dendrodendritic connections between
interneurons via gap junctions ("electical synapses").

<P>
<B>Detour:</B> <A HREF="plasticity-tut.html">Implementing synaptic plasticity</A>

<P>
In these examples, the value of the synaptic weight has been held fixed.
In any biological cortical network, the response of cells to synaptic
inputs varies with time. The tutorial on
<A HREF="plasticity-tut.html">Implementing synaptic plasticity</A>
describes how phenomena such as long term potentiation and depression
(LTP and LTD) may be efficiently implemented in GENESIS.

<P>

The approach used in this tutorial may also be used to create larger
networks.  However, GENESIS has a number of commands that are intended
specifically to create large arrays of cells and to connect them into
a network, with just a few lines of scripting code.  That is the
subject of the next section.
