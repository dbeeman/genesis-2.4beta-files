<H1>Creating large networks with GENESIS</H1>
<P>
Now that we know how to make models of single neurons, and to make
simple circuits of synaptically-connected neurons, it's time to get
the next step in "modelimg the brain" -- creating large networks of
biologically realistic neurons, connected according to our best
knowledge from physiology.

<P> The procedure for constructing of large networks with GENESIS is covered
in <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> Chapter 18.  This chapter gives
detailed descriptions for using the various options of the network creation
commands that are summarized in the <A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">GENESIS
Reference Manual</A> section on Synaptic Connections.  The WAM-BAMM 2005
Advanced Tutorial on Constructing Large-scale Network Models at <A
HREF="http://www.wam-bamm.org/WB05/Tutorials">
http://www.wam-bamm.org/WB05/Tutorials</A> provides some good advice on the
issues encountered, and describes the process of constructing biologically
realistic large networks of neurons.  It uses examples taken from an improved
"next-generation" model of the piriform cortex.

<P>
The chapter in the BoG uses examples from the venerable
<i>genesis/Scripts/orient_tut</i> simulation, a very simple
model of orientation selectivity, involving two layers of cells.

<P>
This tutorial uses a somewhat simpler example, consisting of a grid of
simplified neocortical regular spiking pyramidal cells, each one coupled
with excitory synaptic connections to its four nearest neighbors.  This
might model the connections due to local association fibers in a cortical
network.  The example simulation, in the <i>networks/RSnet</i> directory,
was designed to be easily modified to allow you to use other cell models,
implement other patterns of connectivity, or to augment it with a
population of inhibitory interneurons and the several other types of
connections in a cortical network.

<P> You may examine the cell model itself, and explore its response to
different types of inputs by running and examining the scripts in the
<i>cells/RScell</i> directory, and the
<A HREF="textScripts/cells/RScell/README.txt">README</A> file.
This is a very simple one-compartment model
that, like the exercise in <A HREF="simplecell-tut.html">Building a cell the
easy way</A>, uses a Muscarinic potassium current (KM) in order to achieve
spike frequency adaption.  This model, based on a paper and simulation by
Destexhe et al. (2001), uses channels that give more realistic firing patterns
than those in our exercise.  The simplicity of this cell model allows our
example network of 625 neurons to run fairly quickly.

<P> But, it is important to note that single-compartment models with only
these three ionic conductances have limitations.  Although the KM current may
play a role in spike frequency adaption of cortical pyramidal cells, the
behavior of these cells is largely determined by calcium currents and at least
two varieties of calcium-activated potassium currents.  You may explore some
more realistic cortical pyramidal cell models by running the simulations in
the <i>cells/corticalcells</i> directory.  The <i>genesis/Scripts/traub91</i>
tutorial demonstrates the effects of these currents in burst-firing
hippocampal pyramidal cells.  For more on this subject, you can follow the
detour:

<P>
<b>Detour:</b> <a href="better-cells.html">Making more realistic cell
models</a>

<H2>The example simulation</H2>

<P>
Before we dissect the
<a href="textScripts/networks/RSnet/RSnet.g.txt">RSnet.g</a> script,
let's look at the simulation and its GUI.   As with the scripts for
RScell and simplecell2, the main script and the GUI (in <i>graphics.g</i>) were
designed as fairly general templates that you can modify to experiment with
your own network and cell models.  It can be customized for another cell by
changing strings that are defined in the main script.

<P>
When you run <i>RSnet.g</i> with the default parameters, you will see
something like:

<P ALIGN=CENTER><img src="images/RSnet.gif">
<P>
The CONTROL PANEL allows injection pulses to be applied to a selected cell in
the network and/or random synaptic activation to be applied to each cell.  The
latter is done by setting the 'Frequency' dialog box to a non-zero value.
This sets the frequency field of each synchan to the given value.  The
injection may be turned on and off by clicking on the 'Current Injection
ON/OFF' toggle.  Under 'Connection Parameters', 'synchan gmax' is used to set
the gmax field of the synchan of each cell. The 'Weight' parameter acts as a
multiplier of gmax for connections to the cells, but not for the random
activation.  Thus, the amplitude of the of the random synaptic input can be
increased or decreased relative to the network synaptic input by appropriate
scaling of 'synchan gmax' and 'Weight'.

<P>
The 'Delay' dialog is for setting the fixed axonal delay of each synchan to
the same value.  Comments in RSnet.g explain how to use a conduction
velocity instead, to scale the delay according to the distance between cells.

<P> You can explore the connections that are made by invoking the
<i>synapse_info</i> function at the genesis prompt. This function is
defined, with further explanation, in the file <i>synapseinfo.g</i>, which
is included by <i>RSnet.g</i>. For example,

<PRE>
genesis #5 > synapse_info /network/cell[312]/soma/Ex_channel
synapse[0] : src = /network/cell[287]/soma/spike weight =10 delay =0.002
synapse[1] : src = /network/cell[311]/soma/spike weight =10 delay =0.002
synapse[2] : src = /network/cell[313]/soma/spike weight =10 delay =0.002
synapse[3] : src = /network/cell[337]/soma/spike weight =10 delay =0.002
</PRE>

The 'Membrane Potenial' plot shows Vm for the center cell soma, and that
for ones on the right edge and lower left corner.  Each of these additional
plots is displaced vertically from the others by 0.05 V, for easier viewing.

<P> The function <i>make_netview</i>, defined in <i>graphics.g</i>,
illustrates the use of the <b>xview</b> widget to display the Vm of each
cell on the grid, using a cold to hot colorscale.  To speed up the
simulation somewhat, the line that invokes this function may be commented
out.

<H2>Constructing the network</H2>

<P>
There are five steps to constructing the network.  Each of these is described
in a corresponding commented section of
<a href="textScripts/networks/RSnet/RSnet.g.txt">RSnet.g</a>.

<OL>
  <LI>Create any prototype channels, compartments, etc. that will be used
to build the cells.

  <LI>Create a prototype cell, coupled to an excitatory synchan and a spikegen.

  <LI>Use the <i>createmap</i> command to copy the prototype into a 2D array
   of cells.

  <LI>Use the <i>planarconnect</i> command to connect each cell's spikegen to
   synchans on the four nearest neighbors.

  <LI>Use the <i>planardelay</i> and <i>planarweight</i> commands to
   provide appropriate axonal delays and synaptic weights to the
   connections.

</OL>
<P>
Here are the statements used in
<a href="textScripts/networks/RSnet/RSnet.g.txt">RSnet.g</a>
for each of these steps:

<P>
Step 1: Assemble the components to build the prototype cell under the
<b>neutral</b> element <i>/library</i>, all of this is done in the
<a href="textScripts/networks/RSnet/protodefs.g.txt">protodefs.g</a>
file, which is similar to those used in making the prototypes used
for single cell models:

<P>
<PRE>
include protodefs.g  // This creates /library with the cell components
</PRE>

<P> Step 2: Create the prototype cell specified in <a
href="textScripts/networks/RSnet/RScell.p.txt">RScell.p</a>, using
<i>readcell</i>.  Then, set the maximal conductance of the excitatory
synchan in the appropriate compartment, and the threshold and absolute
refractory period of the spikegen that is attached to the soma.

<P>
<PRE>
readcell RScell.p /library/cell
setfield /library/cell/soma/Ex_channel gmax {gmax}
setfield /library/cell/soma/spike thresh 0  abs_refract 0.004  output_amp 1
</PRE>

<P>
In this case, the synchan is in the soma compartment, with the maximal
conductance specified in the variable 'gmax'.  A spike will be generated 
when Vm exceeds a voltage of zero, unless one has previously been genereated
within the last 4 msec.

<P>
Step 3: Make a two-dimensional array of cells with copies of
<i>/library/cell</i>.

<P>
<PRE>
createmap /library/cell /network {NX} {NY} -delta {SEP_X} {SEP_Y}
</PRE>

<P> The usage of the <a href="textDoc/createmap.doc.txt">createmap</a> command
is

<P>
<PRE>
createmap source dest Nx Ny -delta dx dy [-origin x y]
</PRE>

<P>
There will be NX cells along the x-direction, separated by SEP_X,
nd  NY cells along the y-direction, separated by SEP_Y.
The default origin is (0, 0).  This will be the coordinates of cell[0].
The last cell, cell[{NX*NY-1}], will be at (NX*SEP_X -1, NY*SEP_Y-1).

<P>
In this example simulation, SEP_X and SEP_Y are set to 0.001 m.  Cortical
networks typically have pyramidal cell separations on the order of 10
micrometers, and have pyramidal cell axonal projections of up to a
millimeter.  With these separations, a 25 by 25 grid of neurons would be
only 0.25 mm on a side.  By using an artificially large value of 1 mm for
the separations, the model can represent a cortical area of about an inch
on a side.  In this case, the neurons in the model are a sparse sample of
the those in the actual network, and each one of them represents many in
the biological network.  To compensate for this, the conductance of each
synapse is scaled by a synaptic weight factor, to represent the increased
number of neurons that would be providing input in the actual network.  The
large separation value used in this example would be appropriate for a
piriform cortex model with long range connections between cells.

<P> Step 4: Now connect them up, using the <i>planarconnect</i> command.
This command establishes synaptic connections between groups of elements
based on the x-y positions of the elements.  It does this by by adding
SPIKE messages between source and destination elements, using a large
number of options to specify just which ones are to be included.  Although
this makes the syntax somewhat complex, it allows a wide variety of
patterns of connections.  The usage is of the form

<P>
<PRE>
     planarconnect source-path destination-path
               [-relative]
               [-sourcemask {box,ellipse} xmin ymin xmax ymax]
               [-sourcehole {box,ellipse} xmin ymin xmax ymax]
               [-destmask   {box,ellipse} xmin ymin xmax ymax]
               [-desthole   {box,ellipse} xmin ymin xmax ymax]
               [-probability p]
</PRE>

<P>

These options are described in more detail in Chapter 18 of the <A
HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A>, and the documentation for <a
href="textDoc/planarconnect.doc.txt">planarconnect</a>.

<P>
In this simulation, we want to connect each source spike generator to the
excitatory synchans on the four nearest neighbors.  To do this, we define the
sourcemask to be a rectangle (box) with a very large range (-1 to +1 meters!), so that
every cell in the network will be treated as a source.  We want the
destination, relative to the source to be an ellipse (or circle) that is large
enough to include the four neighbors.  It is generally a good idea to set the
destmask ellipse axes or box size somewhat higher than the cell spacing, to be
sure that the cells are included.  Although this isn't a problem with our
single-compartment cell, it can be an issue if the destination synapses
are located in a distal dendrite compartment that is displaced by some amount
from the cell origin.  We also want to define a "destination hole" region
that excludes the source cell, so that it doesn't connect to itself.
This is implemented in <i>RSnet.g</i> with the statement:

<P>
<PRE>
planarconnect /network/cell[]/soma/spike /network/cell[]/soma/Ex_channel \
    -relative \     // Destination coordinates are measured relative to source
    -sourcemask box -1 -1  1  1 \   // Larger than source area -&gt; all cells
    -destmask ellipse 0 0 {SEP_X*1.2}  {SEP_Y*1.2} \
    -desthole box {-SEP_X*0.5} {-SEP_Y*0.5} {SEP_X*0.5} {SEP_Y*0.5} \
    -probability 1.1    // set probability &gt; 1 to connect to all in destmask
</PRE>
<P>

The figure below illustrates how these options would be applied to a
network of 64 cells with NX = NY = 8.  The particular source cell for the
connections shown (one of all in the sourcemask, i.e. all of cells) is
number 3 + 3*NX = 27.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><img src="images/planarconnect_regions.gif">
<P>

Note the use of the <i>wildcard notation</i> 'cell[]' to indicate all
indices of the cell objects.  Here, the 'desthole' could just as well have
been an ellipse.  The variables SEP_X and SEP_Y had previously been set to
the desired spacing between cells, 0.001 meters.

<P>
To connect to nearest neighbors and the 4 diagonal neighbors, we would
use a box for the destmask:

<P>
<PRE>
    -destmask box {-SEP_X*1.01} {-SEP_Y*1.01} {SEP_X*1.01} {SEP_Y*1.01}
</PRE>
<P>
For all-to-all connections with a 10% probability, set both the sourcemask
and the destmask to have a range much greater than NX*SEP_X using options

<P>
<PRE>
    -destmask box -1 -1  1  1<BR>
    -probability 0.1
</PRE>
<P>
Step 5: Set the axonal propagation delay and weight fields of the target
synchan synapses, for all spikegens, to the values previously defined
for 'prop_delay' and syn_weight':

<P>
<PRE>
planardelay /network/cell[]/soma/spike -fixed {prop_delay}
planarweight /network/cell[]/soma/spike -fixed {syn_weight}
</PRE>
<P>
To scale the delays according to distance instead of using a fixed delay, use

<P>
<PRE>
planardelay /network/cell[]/soma/spike -radial {cond_vel}
</PRE>
<P>
and change the dialogs in graphics.g to set 'cond_vel'.  This would be
appropriate when connections are made to more distant cells.

<P> Other options described in the documentation for <a
href="textDoc/planardelay.doc.txt">planardelay</a> and <a
href="textDoc/planarweight.doc.txt">planarweight</a> allow some randomized
variations in the delay and weight, to make a more realistic simulation of
a biological network.  There are also three-dimensional equivalents to
these coommands, called <i>volumeconnect</i>, <i>volumedelay</i>, and
<i>volumeweight</i>.  The <a
href="textDoc/setrandfield.txt">setrandfield</a> command is useful for for
randomizing fields in a cell compartment or channel according to a
specified distribution.  When used with passive cell parameters or resting
potentials, this can allow a more natural variation in the cells composing
the network.


<H2>GENESIS tools for analyzing spiking networks</H2>

<P>
The GENESIS Reference Manual section on Objects describes several
"Device Objects" that can be used for spike train analysis:
<PRE>
  autocorr        Calculates histograms of auto-correlations
  crosscorr       Calculates histograms of cross-correlations
  freq_monitor    calculates running event (spike) frequency
  interspike      Generates an interspike interval histogram
  peristim        Generates a peristimulus spike histogram
  event_tofile    Records event times; e.g spikes or threshold crossings
</PRE>
<P>

These objects can be used to generate histograms for analysis of spike
trains.  More details can be found in the documentation for these objects,
and in the example script in the <i>genesis/Scripts/examples/spike/</i>
directory.
There is a good introductory tutorial on the the use of statistical
correlation functions to analyze spike train data at
<A HREF="http://mulab.physiol.upenn.edu/analysis.html">
http://mulab.physiol.upenn.edu/analysis.html</A>.


<H2>Some other things to try</H2>

<P>
The behavior of this network is affected by "edge effects", because the
cells on the edges have fewer connections.  Periodic boundary conditions
are often used with small networks in order to approximate the behavior of
a network of infinite size.  Modify the connections in the RSnet example
so that each cell on an edge is connected to the corresponding cell on the
opposite edge.  Is the behavior different from that of the original
version with "open boundary conditions"?

<P>
The example script in <i>genesis/Scripts/examples/fileconnect</i> gives
an example of reading in a network connection matrix from a file with the
<i>fileconnect</i> command.

<P>
If you would like to experiment with models having spike timing dependent
plasticity, see the documentation for the hebbsynchan and facsynchan objects,
and the examples in the GENESIS <i>Scripts/examples</i> directory.
The "Libraries" section of user contributions at the GENESIS web site
also contains the stdpSynchan object, a synchan with
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).

<P> The <i>networks/synfirenet</i> directory contains an example of a
different type of network connectivity, the <i>synfire chain</i>.  These
scripts were developed by Dieter Jaeger as as an exercise in script
programming of networks, and the scripts were designed to be easily
modified.  The network model also allows Hebbian learning.
The main script is <i>netsim.g</i>.  The GUI lets you experiment with
the model, and the HELP menu offers suggestions on ways to modify the
model.  The <A HREF="textScripts/networks/synfirenet/README.txt">README</A> file
explains about synfire chains and the details of this model.

<P>
More realistic cortical cell models tend to have a more pronounced
hyperpolarization after the action potentials and a "more absolute"
refractory period.  This makes it possible to have propagating rings of
activation generated by injection pulses, rather than continuous firing,
as in this model.  (For example, see Kudela et al. 1999).  Modify the RSnet
simulation to use the more detailed BDK5cell neocortical pyramidal model
from the <i>cells/corticalcells</i> directory, and see if you can produce this
effect.  What effect does the propagation delay have on the waves?
The detour on <a href="better-cells.html">Making more realistic cell
models</a> gives more suggestions for constructing realistic neuron
models.


<P> What is the effect of using even simpler neuron models in the same
network?  The <i>iznet.g</i> script in the GENESIS <i>Scripts/examples/izcell</i>
directory is a variation of the RSnet model, using the Izhikevich (2003)
simple spiking neuron model.  Can it be "tuned" to produce the same network
behaviors as the networks with more complex neurons?  (This requires
GENESIS 2.3 or later.)

<P>
Another 'exercise for the reader' would be to use the GENESIS parameter search
routines to vary the RScell parameters, in order to create a cell that more
closely duplicates the current injection behavior seen in a specific set of
experimental data.  Then compare the two models when used in a network.

<P>
Of course, a realistic cortical network will have a large number of inhibitory
connections, mediated by interneurons that receive excitatory inputs and then
make inhibitory connections to pyramidal cells.  The lack of inhibition in
this example network is responsible for the fact that, once a wave of
excitation begins to propagate, the cells are firing near their maximum
frequency and, as seen in the 'Membrane Potenial' plot, the amplitude of the
action potentials is somewhat reduced because of this overstimulation.
Inhibitory interneurons are generally of the "Fast Spiking" category, with
little or no spike frequency adaptation, such as the simplecell model that we
examined previously.  Try adding a layer of these cells to the network, and
make suitable excitatory connections to them from the RScells, and connections
from them to inhibitory synchans in the RScells. The well documented network
model in <A
HREF="../networks/Vogels-Abbott_net/index.html">networks/Vogels-Abbot_net</A>
implements the Vogels and Abbott (2005) model using single compartment
neurons with Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics, instead of integrate and fire
neurons.  This simple network has random connections between populations of
excitatory and inhibitory cells.  Although this is not a very biologically
realistic model, the <A HREF="../networks/Vogels-Abbott_net/index.html">
documentation</A> and comments in the scripts describe many options to modify
the network connectivity and to incorporate more realistic cell models.

<P>

This July 2014 update of the tutorials package has two recent
variations on the Vogels and Abbott model. The
<A HREF="../networks/VAnet2/README.html">networks/VAnet</A> simulation
serves as a tutorial on using hsolve with network models in order
speed up simulations by factors of ten to
twenty. The 
<A HREF="../networks/ACnet2-GENESIS/README.html">networks/ACnet2-GENESIS</A>
simulation is a study of cortical waves in primary auditory
cortex that evolved from the models used in this tutorial.

<P>
The <i>cells/FScell</i> directory contains a simple fast spiking cell simulation,
similar to the ones in <i>cells/simplecell</i> and <i>cells/simplecell2</i>.
Alternatively, a fast fast spiking cell could be created from
the RScell model by removing the muscarinic current.

<P> The classic "Synaptic Organization of the Brain" (Shepherd, 2003)
contains multi-authored reviews of our current understanding of the "wiring
diagrams" of different portions of the brain.  Binzegger et al. (2004) give
a detailed quntitative analysis of the connections in primary visual
cortex.  More information on the statistics of the distribution of local
connections between cortical pyramidal cells can be found in Holmgren et
al. (2003), who measured pyramidal-pyramidal and pyramidal-interneuron
connection probablilites in layer 2/3 as a function of distance, and in
Thomson and Bannister (2003), who presented a review of local interlaminar
connections.

<H2>Detour: Parallelizing network simulations</H2>
<P>
Once you begin creating large network models, you will want to run even
larger models in less time.  As computers are reaching the practical limit
of CPU speed, it is becoming more common to use multicore processors that
effectively turn a PC into a parallel computer. As of mid-2008, it was
possible to buy a PC with a quad core CPU for under $1000, and eight core
processors will be available in year or two. This offers the prospect of
harnessing this power by using PGENESIS under Linux to turn an inexpensive
PC into a fast parallel computer for running large GENESIS network
simulations.

<P>
The <A HREF="../advanced-tutorials/Mini-tuts/pgenesis/index.html">Mini-tutorial
on Using Parallel GENESIS on PCs with Multicore Processors</A> tells you
what you need to know to get PGENESIS running under the MPI environment
on PCs with Linux.

<P>
Once you have PGENESIS installed, you are ready to try out a parallel
version of the RSnet simulation, and to use the tutorial
<A HREF="par-net-tut.html">Converting large network simulations to
PGENESIS</A>.  This analyzes the differences between RSnet and the
parallel version par-RSnet in order to explain the steps needed
to parallelize a network simulation that was developed for serial GENESIS.

<P>
<H2>Detour: Implementing synaptic plasticity</H2>

<P>
In these examples, the value of the synaptic weight has been held fixed.
In any biological cortical network, the response of cells to synaptic
inputs varies with time. The tutorial on
<A HREF="plasticity-tut.html">Implementing synaptic plasticity</A>
describes how phenomena such as long term potentiation and depression
(LTP and LTD) may be efficiently implemented in GENESIS.

<P>
<H2>What next?</H2>

<P>
Now you have the tools to begin "modeling the brain".  The final section
of this tutorial "<A HREF="whatnext.html">Where do we go from here?</A>"
