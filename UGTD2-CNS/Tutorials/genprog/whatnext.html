<H1>Where do we go from here?</H1>
<P>
Here are some suggestions and resources for learning more advanced
GENESIS programming techniques.  Also see the
<A HREF="../advanced-tutorials/index.html">advanced tutorials</A>
in this tutorial distribution with links to other longer tutorials
on the GENESIS website.

<H2>Using implicit numerical methods</H2>
<P>
The default integration method (exponential Euler) is fine for simple
models with just a few compartments.  Models with many compartments should
use an implicit method (e.g. Crank-Nicholson) with the Hines algorithm
in order to avoid numerical instablilities.   This is implemented, along
with other speedups, in the GENESIS <i>hsolve</i> object.
This is covered in <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A>
Chapter 20 and the GENESIS documentation for
<a href="textDoc/hsolve.doc.txt">hsolve</a>.  For example scripts,
see <i>genesis/Scripts/examples/hines</i> for examples.
The advanced tutorial by Hugo Cornelis from the 2002 GENESIS Users Meeting
<A HREF="../advanced-tutorials/index.html">Simulations with GENESIS using
hsolve</A> gives further examples.

<H2>Spike train objects in GENESIS</H2>
<P>

To understand single neuron computation it is desirable that realistic
input patterns be given to model neurons in the study of the input-output
function.  Spike train objects can be used to generate input patterns in
place of a full network model, which is often not available.  Other GENESIS
objects can be used to generate histograms of cross-correlations,
auto-correlations, interspike intervals, and others.  The WAM-BAMM 2005 <A
HREF="../advanced-tutorials/index.html"> Advanced Tutorial</A> on
"Simulating in vivo-like synaptic input patterns in multicompartmental
models" (Edgerton, 2005) describes how realistic input patterns can be
given to model neurons, using the tools available in GENESIS.  The
electronically published version may be viewed or downloaded at <A

<H2>Using GENESIS on parallel computers</H2>
<P>

Parallel GENESIS (PGENESIS) is an extension of GENESIS for use on parallel
computers and networks of workstations.  It is useful for simulations that
must be run many times independently, such as parameter searching, and is
used for large scale models that can benefit from the speed advantages of
parallelism, especially large network models.  The WAM-BAMM 2005 <A
HREF="../advanced-tutorials/index.html">Advanced Tutorial</A> on Parallel
GENESIS presents in-depth example scripts, and discusses topics such as
efficient network partitioning, sychronization issues, parallel I/O,
parallel parameter searching, load balancing, scaling behavior, and
debugging strategies.  The electronically published version (Hood, 2005) may
be viewed or downloaded at <A
HREF="http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/227">
http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/227</A>.
PGENESIS is also covered in considerable detail in <A
HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> Chapter 21.
The Mini-Tutorial<A HREF="../advanced-tutorials/Mini-tuts/pgenesis/index.html">
Using Parallel GENESIS on PCs with Multicore Processors</A> gives a "quick
start" guide to intalling PGENESIS under Linux on PCs using the MPI
environment.

<H2>Other examples and GENESIS features</H2>

<P>

For performing parameter searches to "tune" a model, see
<i>genesis/Scripts/param</i>, and the documentation for the GENESIS
Parameter Search Library given in the <A
HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">GENESIS Reference Manual</A>.  The WAM-BAMM
2005 Advanced Tutorial on Parameter Searching Tools in GENESIS at
<A HREF="http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/WB05-advanced-tutorials">
http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/WB05-advanced-tutorials</A> gives a good overview of
parameter searching and a discussion of the issues involved, suggestions,
hints, and pitfalls.

<P> A demonstration of the use of GENESIS for modeling biochemical
reactions such as occur in biochemical signaling pathways can be found in
<i>genesis/Scripts/kinetikit</i>, and in the <A
HREF="../advanced-tutorials/index.html">advanced tutorials</A> on Modeling
Calcium and Biochemical Reactions from WAM-BAMM 2005 and LASCON 2008.  Some
of the included example scripts use <i>chemesis</i>, a library of
biochemical reaction objects for modeling calcium concentration, which is
also included. The website for chemesis is  <A
HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/krasnow/CENlab/chemesis.html">
http://www.gmu.edu/departments/krasnow/CENlab/chemesis.html</A>.
Chapter 10 of the <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A>
provides an introduction to the biochemistry involved, and a tutorial on
Kinetikit and the GENESIS kinetics library.

<P> If you need to create your own new GENESIS objects and commands, see the
documentation on Customizing GENESIS in the <A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">
GENESIS Reference Manual</A>.

<P>
The <i>genesis/Scripts/examples</i> directory has examples of other GENESIS
capabilities such as hebbian and facilitating synapses, markovian channels,
Ca diffusion in spines, and various types of device objects for input and
output, or for applying stimuli to model neurons.

<P> For a summary of all the objects that are available in GENESIS, see the
Objects section in the <A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">GENESIS Reference
Manual</A>.  To simply see a list of available objects, type
"<tt>listobjects</tt>" from within GENESIS.  To see a list of commands, type
"<tt>listcommands</tt>".
