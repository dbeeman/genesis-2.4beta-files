<A NAME="section-1"><H1>Introduction</H1></A>

<P>

This is an updated version of the multi-part GENESIS Modeling Tutorial that
was first introduced during the 2005 WAM-BAMM
(<A HREF="http://www.wam-bamm.org">http://www.wam-bamm.org</A>)
meeting on realistic biological modeling in San Antonio, TX.  It was offered
as a "take-home" hands-on tutorial to be used for self-study, following the
<A HREF="../genesis-intro/genesis-intro.html">
Introduction to Realistic Neural Modeling</A> tutorial.  The tutorial was
further developed during use in the 2006 and 2008 Latin American School on Computational
Neuroscience (LASCON), and the Frankfurt Institute of Advanced
Studies (FIAS 2006) summer school on theoretical neuroscience and
complex systems.  It is intended to be a "quick start" to creating simulations
with GENESIS, and will give you enough information to let you quickly
begin creating cells and networks with GENESIS.

<P>One way to use the tutorial is to go through it at a leisurely pace,
exploring all the links to detailed information and documentation as you
create models and perform the exercises.  Another way is to take the most
direct path, creating models without always understanding the details of what
you have done.  If you opt for this path, be sure to return to pick up the
details when your lack of understanding makes progress difficult.  Take your
pick!

<P>
The tutorial makes frequent references and links to sections of the <A
HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">GENESIS Reference Manual</A>.  This is
primarily a summary of the syntax used by the GENESIS Script Language
Interpreter, the commands which it recognizes, and of the GENESIS
"objects" that are available for constructing simulations.  It also
refers to chapters in <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">
<i>The Book of GENESIS</i></A>, by James M. Bower and David Beeman.  The second edition
of this book, familiarly called "The BoG", was originally published by
Springer-Verlag.  As the publisher does not plan to reprint the book, the
copyright has been reclaimed by the authors, and we are now able to offer
it as a free "Internet Edition", with links to it in this package of
Tutorials.

<P>
The BoG gives a detailed coverage of realistic neural modeling from the
subcellular to the network level, and provides the detailed guide to the
construction of GENESIS simulations that is missing from the Reference
Manual.  This tutorial is constructed to minimize your need for the BoG.
Nevertheless, this short tutorial can't possibly go into all the detail of a
482 page book, so you may wish study it in some detail, if you later decide to
do some serious work with GENESIS.  There are links to chapters in the
BoG throughout this tutorial, in order to provide more information on some
of the topics that we will cover.

<H2>GENESIS Scripting</H2>

<P> If you have read the <a href="../genesis-intro/genesis-intro.html">
Introduction to Realistic Neural Modeling</a>, you will be familiar with the
rich variety of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that are possible with
GENESIS.  In fact, it is possible to create and run GENESIS simulations with
little or no programming, by using Neurokit (for single cells) or Kinetikit
(for biochemical reactions).  But, sooner or later, you will want the
flexibility of creating your own GENESIS scripts.  

<P>
The bad news is that to get the maximum benefit from
GENESIS and from this tutorial, you will have to do some programming in the
GENESIS scripting language.
The good news is that the modular object-oriented nature of GENESIS makes
it easy to modify existing scripts.  Once you have learned a few basics of
GENESIS scripting and have some good example simulation scripts to get you
started, you can create most of your simulations by simple "hacking" of
existing scripts.  That is the approach taken in this tutorial, and by most
GENESIS modelers.

<H2>Some preliminaries</H2>

<P>
Before you start, you will need a little background.

<UL>

  <LI> You should have some basic knowledge of compartmental modeling, which
is covered in detail in the BoG.  You can get a brief overview in parts of the
<A HREF="../cnslecs/cnslecs.html"> Lectures on Computational Neuroscience</A>.
The book <i>Methods in Neuronal Modeling</i>, by C. Koch and I. Segev (eds.)
second edition, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (1998), is another good reference.
The <a href="../genesis-intro/genesis-intro.html"> Introduction to Realistic
Neural Modeling</a> will also be a good background for understanding what
follows.

<P>
  <LI> You should have GENESIS installed, and know how to start it up.  You
will need to know <i>where</i> GENESIS is installed.  There will be a
directory <i>genesis</i> that contains the executable program
"<i>genesis</i>" and other directories, such as <i>Scripts</i>, which
contains the example and tutorial simulation scripts that are distributed
with GENESIS.  So, when we refer to <i>genesis/Scripts</i>, you will need
to know the full path, e.g.  <i>/usr/local/genesis/Scripts</i>, in order to
locate these files.  You will also need to know where these tutorials are
installed, as they may refer to the "GENESIS Tutorials directory", or to a
file within this directory such as <i>cells/simplecell/simplecell.g</i>.

<P>
The "GENESIS Tutorials directory" is an optional package that would normally
be installed as <i>genesis/Tutorials</i>.  It contains this tutorial
(in <i>Tutorials/genprog</i>),  other GENESIS tutorials, the <i>cells</i>
directory (in <i>Tutorials/cells</i>),  and other directories
used by the GENESIS tutorials.
The procedure for obtaining, installing and running GENESIS and the
Tutorials package is given in the <a href="../README.html">README</a> file
in the Tutorials directory.

<P>
  <LI> You will need to know how to get around in a UNIX command-line
environment, and how to use a text editor.  Fortunately, you only need to know
a little.  You can learn most of what you need to know about UNIX in order
to use GENESIS in this <a href="../unixhelp/unixhelp.html">
Introduction to UNIX or Linux and the graphical desktop</a>.

</UL>

<P> The two most common UNIX editors for plain text files, such as GENESIS
scripts, are 'vi' and 'emacs'.  If you are not familiar with either editor,
you may find it easier to learn <a href="../unixhelp/emacs.txt">emacs</a>.
For an even simpler text editor with built-in help, try 'pico' if it is
installed.  If you are using Linux with the GNOME or KDE desktop, try
'gedit', 'kedit", or 'kate'.  If you are running GENESIS under Windows
using the Cygwin (<A
HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</A>) environment, use
'nedit'.
