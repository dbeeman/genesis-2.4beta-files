<H1>Creating and modifying channel models</H1>

<P>
You can find prototype definitions for many specific types of channels in
the <i>genesis/Scripts/neurokit/prototypes</i> directory.  The files in
this directory, <a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/LIST.txt">
LIST</a> and <a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/LIST.description.txt">
LIST.description</a>, summarize the ones that are available.

<P>
Many of these prototype files make use of the variable EREST_ACT, which can
be changed to another value, in order to shift the voltage dependence of
the steady state activation and time constant up or down.  For example,
<i>hh_tchan.g</i> was designed for a mitral cell simulation with a resting
potential of -0.06 volts.  The simplecell simulation changed this to -0.07
volts for use in a cell that has a resting potential of -0.07 volts.

<P>
At some point, you may need to make more extensive changes in these
scripts, or write your own.  As a start, we will examine the K channel that
is implemented with a <b>tabchannel</b> object by the
<i>make_K_hh_tchan</i> function in <i>hh_tchan.g</i>.  Older GENESIS
simulations, such as <i>tutorial3.g</i>, implement this type of channel
with the <b>hh_channel</b> object.  We recommend that you use the faster
and more versatile <b>tabchannel</b>, instead.
<i>genesis/Scripts/tutorials/newtutorial3.g</i> shows how to use
tabchannels instead of the hh_channels that are used in <i>tutorial3.g</i>.

<P>
The basic equations that determine the conductance of the K channel in
the squid giant axon are:

<p align=center><IMG SRC="images/HHeqns.gif">
 
<P>
The simulator will solve the equation for <i>dn/dt</i>, so it is only
necessary to specify the maximum conductance, represented by the field Gbar
in the <b>tabchannel</b> object, the exponents for up to three gates (of
which we only have one, <i>n</i>), and tables to represent the voltage
dependence of the last two equations for the rate variables <i>alpha</i>
and <i>beta</i>.

<P>
The relevant part of <i>hh_tchan.g</i> is

<PRE>
    str chanpath = "K_hh_tchan"

    create tabchannel {chanpath}

    setfield ^ Ek {EK} Gbar {360.0*SOMA_A} Ik 0 Gk 0  \
                Xpower 4 Ypower 0 Zpower 0

    setupalpha {chanpath} X {10e3*(0.01 + EREST_ACT)} -10.0e3  \
        -1.0 {-1.0*(0.01 + EREST_ACT)} -0.01 125.0 0.0 0.0  \
            {-1.0*EREST_ACT} 80.0e-3
</PRE>

<P>
This sets the reversal potential Ek to the value previously assigned to the
variable EK, and the exponent for the <i>n</i> gate (represented by the X
gate field of the <b>tabchannel</b>) to 4.  As there is no inactivation or
other gate, the exponents for the Y and Z gates are set to 0 (the default).
Gbar will normally be set by the cell reader, but it is given the
Hodgkin-Huxley value of 360 S/m^2 times the soma area, in case it is used
without the cell reader, with an appropriate value of SOMA_A.  Setting Ik
and Gk is not really necessary, as they will be recalculated by the
simulator.

<P>
The function <i>setupalpha</i> uses a generalized version of the
Hodgkin-Huxley rate variables <i>alpha</i> and <i>beta</i>, namely (A +
B*Vm)/(C + exp((Vm + D)/F)), in order to set up the <b>tabchannel</b>
tables.  The 10 arguments correspond to the A, B, C, D, and F parameters
for <i>alpha</i> and for <i>beta</i>.  A similar function, <i>setuptau</i>,
allows this form to represent the voltage-dependent activation time
constant and steady state activation, instead.  A large percentage of
published voltage-dependent Hodgkin-Huxley type channel models fit this
general form.  For the others, one has to fill the tables with either an
equation evaluated in a loop, or a set of experimentally measured values.
The <a href="textDoc/tabchannel.doc.txt">documentation for tabchannel</a>
gives the details.  It would also be useful to look at the documentation
for <a href="textDoc/setupalpha.doc.txt">setupalpha</a>, <a
href="textDoc/setuptau.doc.txt">setuptau</a>, <a
href="textDoc/tweakalpha.doc.txt">tweakalpha</a>, and <a
href="textDoc/tweaktau.doc.txt">tweaktau</a>.

<P>

Chapter 19 of the <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> covers the use of
tabchannels to make calcium-dependent and other types of channels, using
examples from the <a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/traub91chan.g.txt">
traub91chan.g</a> and <a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/ASTchan.g.txt">
ASTchan.g</a> prototype files. These files are extensively commented, and
illustrate many of the ways to use a <b>tabchannel</b>.  For Ca-dependent
channels, be sure to read the documentation for the <a
href="textDoc/Ca_concen.doc.txt">Ca_concen</a> object.
