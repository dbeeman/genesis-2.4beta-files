<H1>A basic tutorial on using GENESIS</H1>

<P>
<I>Originally written by : Matt Wilson</I><BR>
<B>Tutorial #1</B> <BR>

<P>
<B>A Basic Tutorial on GENESIS - Constructing a Simple Compartment</B> <BR>

<P>
This document will guide you through a brief session under GENESIS in which
you will use the basic features of the simulator to create and run a simple
simulation.

<P>

<H2>Some Notation</A>
</H2>

<P>
In this guide you will be instructed, at various points, to enter
GENESIS commands through the keyboard. This will be indicated
by showing the text that you should enter in a monospaced "typewriter" font.
For example: 

<PRE>
    type this
</PRE>

<P>


<H2>Getting Started</H2>

<P>
To run the simulator, first make sure that you are at the UNIX shell
command prompt.  At the prompt type <TT>genesis</TT>.  If your path is
properly configured this should start up the simulator and display the opening
credits. If you get a message such as <TT>genesis: Command not found</TT>,
check your path (<tt>echo $PATH</tt>) to be sure that it contains the
<i>genesis</i> directory (often <i>/usr/genesis</i>).

<P>

<H2>Interpreter Basics</A>
</H2>

<P>
After the simulator has completed its startup procedure you should see the
GENESIS command prompt "<tt>genesis #0 ></tt>" indicating that you are now
in the GENESIS interpreter (SLI).  In the interpreter you can execute both
UNIX shell and GENESIS commands.  Try this by typing

<PRE>
    ls
</PRE>

<P>
This should invoke the UNIX <I>ls</I> command displaying files in the current
directory. Typing 


<PRE>
    listcommands
</PRE>

<P>
should produce a list of available GENESIS commands.
Note that while there are a large number of available commands, you
will typically use a much smaller subset of these.
It is also possible to combine GENESIS and UNIX shell commands. Typing

<PRE>
    listcommands | more
</PRE>

<P>
will "pipe" the output of the GENESIS command <I>listcommands</I> 
through the UNIX command <I>more</I>, thus allowing you to page through 
the listing. 

<PRE>
    listcommands | lpr
</PRE>

<P>
will <TT>"</TT>pipe<TT>"</TT> the output to the printer and

<PRE>
    listcommands > myfile
</PRE>

<P>
will redirect the output into a file called <TT>"</TT>myfile<TT>"</TT>.

<P>

<H2>Basic Objects</H2>

<P> The building blocks used to create simulations under GENESIS are referred
to as elements. Elements are created from templates called "objects".  The
simulator comes with a number of basic objects. To list the available objects
type 

<PRE>
    listobjects
</PRE>

<P>
To get more information on a particular objects type

<PRE>
    showobject name
</PRE>

<P>
where "name" is replaced by any name from the object list.

<P>
The <B>compartment</B> object is commonly used in GENESIS simulations to
construct parts of neurons.  As we will be using this object, try the
command <TT>showobject compartment</TT> at this time.  There are a few commonly
used objects which are documented more thoroughly with the GENESIS <I>help</I>
command.  In order to obtain a detailed description of the equivalent
circuit for the <B>compartment</B> object, type 


<PRE>
    help compartment
</PRE>

<P>
(HINT: You may pipe these commands into <I>more</I> to prevent the output from
scrolling off the top of the screen.)  For example.

<PRE>
    help compartment | more
</PRE>


<P>

<H2>Creating Elements</H2>

<P>
To create an Element from an Object description you use the <I>create</I>
command.  Try typing the create command without arguments


<PRE>
    create
</PRE>

<P>
This gives a usage statement which gives the proper syntax for using this
command. Most commands will produce a usage statement if invoked without
arguments, or if followed with the option <TT>-usage</TT> or <TT>-help</TT>.
In the case of the <I>create</I> command the usage statement looks like

<PRE>
    usage: create object name -autoindex [object-specific-options]
</PRE>

<P>
In this exercise we will create a simple passive compartment. 
In order to keep track of the many elements that go into a simulation, each
element must be given a name. To create a compartment with the name
<I>soma</I> type 


<PRE>
    create compartment /soma
</PRE>

<P>
Elements are maintained in a hierarchy much like that used to maintain files
in the UNIX operating system.  In this case, <I>/soma</I> is a pathname which
indicates that the soma is to be placed at the root or top of the hierarchy.

<P>
We will eventually build a fairly realistic neuron called <I>/cell</I> with
a soma, dendrites, channels and an axon.  It would be a good idea to organize
these components into a hierarchy of elements such as <I>/cell/soma</I>,
<I>/cell/dend</I>, <I>/cell/dend/Ex_channel</I>, and so on.  If we do
this, we need to create the appropriate type of element for <I>/cell</I>.
GENESIS has a <B>neutral</B> object for this sort of use.  An element of this
type is an empty element that performs no actions and is used chiefly as a
parent element for a hierarchy of child elements.

<P>
To start the construction of our cell, give the commands

<PRE>
    create neutral /cell
    create compartment /cell/soma
</PRE>

<P>
As we no longer need our original element <i>/soma</i>, we may
delete it with the command <I>delete</I>.

<PRE>
    delete /soma
</PRE>

<P>

<H2>Examining Elements</H2>

<P>
The commands for maintaining elements within their hierarchy are
very much like those used to maintain
files in the UNIX operating system. In that spirit, the commands for
moving about within the GENESIS element hierarchy are similar to 
their UNIX counterparts. For example, to list the elements in the
current level of the hierarchy use the <I>le</I> (list elements) command 


<PRE>
    le
</PRE>

<P>
You should see several items listed including the newly created <I>cell</I>.

<P>
Each element contains data fields which contain the values of parameters
and state variables used by the element. To show the contents of these
data fields use the <I>showfield</I> command. 


<PRE>
    showfield /cell *
</PRE>
<P>
This will display the names and contents of the data fields of the "cell".
The "*" indicates that you wish to display all the data fields associated
with the element.
To display the contents of a particular field, type

<PRE>
    showfield /cell/soma Rm
</PRE>

<P>
To display an extended listing of the element contents including a 
description of the object associated with the element, type 

<PRE>
   showfield /cell/soma **
</PRE>

<H2>Moving About in the Hierarchy</H2>

<P>
When working in GENESIS you are always located at a particular element
within the hierarchy which is referred to as the "working element".
This location is used as a default for many commands which require
path specifications. For example, the <i>le</i> command used above
normally takes a path argument. When the path argument is omitted
the working element is used and thus all elements located under the
working element are listed. 
To move about in the hierarchy use the <I>ce</I> (change element) command.
To change the current working element to the newly create soma, type 

<PRE>
    ce /cell/soma
</PRE>
<P>

<P>
Now you can repeat the <i>show</i> command used above omitting the explicit
reference to the <i>/cell/soma</i> pathname. 

<PRE>
    showfield *
</PRE>

<P>
This should display the contents of the <i>/cell/soma</i> data fields.

You may find the current working element by using the <i>pwe</i> (print working
element) command. Try giving the command:


<PRE>
    pwe
</PRE>

<P>
Note the analogy between these commands and the UNIX commands
<i>ls</i>, <i>cd</i>, and <i>pwd</i>.  By analogy with UNIX, GENESIS uses
the symbols "." to refer to the working element, and ".."
to refer to the element above it in the hierarchy. Try using these with
the <i>le</i>, <i>ce</i>, and <i>showfield</i> commands.  Likewise, GENESIS
has <i>pushe</i> and <i>pope</i> commands
to correspond to the UNIX  <i>pushd</i> and <i>popd</i> commands.  These
provide a convenient method of changing to a new working element and
returning to the previous one.  Try the sequence of commands

<PRE>
    pushe /cell
    pwe
    pope
    pwe
</PRE>
<P>

<H2>Modifying Elements</H2>

<P>
The contents of the element data fields can be changed using the
<i>setfield</i> command. To set the transmembrane resistance of your cell type 


<PRE>
    setfield /cell/soma Rm 10
</PRE>

<P>
You can set multiple fields in a single command as in


<PRE>
    setfield /cell/soma Cm 2 Em 25 inject 5
</PRE>

<P>
Now if you do a <i>showfield</i> command on the element you should see the new
values appearing in the data fields. 


<PRE>
    showfield /cell/soma *
</PRE>

<P>
State variables are automatically updated by the elements when they are
"run" during a simulation. For instance the <i>Vm</i> field is a state variable
which, while you can change it, will be updated by the element automatically,
replacing your value.

<P>

<H2>Running a Simulation</H2>

<P>
Before running a simulation the elements must be placed in a known initial
state. This is done using the <i>reset</i> command, which should be performed
prior to all simulation runs. 


<PRE>
    reset
</PRE>

<P>
If you now show the value of the compartment voltage <i>Vm</i> you will see
that it has been reset to the value given by the parameter <i>Em</i>.


<PRE>
     showfield /cell/soma *
</PRE>

<P>
To run a simulation use the <i>step</i> command, which causes the simulator
to advance a given number of simulation steps. 


<PRE>
    step 10
</PRE>

<P>
Displaying the <i>Vm</i> field now shows that the simulator actually did
something and the value has changed from its initial value due to the
current injection.

<PRE>
    showfield /cell/soma Vm
</PRE>

<H2>Adding Graphics</H2>

<P>
Some people find that graphics are more effective than endless columns of
numbers in monitoring the course of a simulation. With that in mind we
will attempt to add a graph to the simulation which will display the
voltage trajectory of your cell.
Graphics are implemented using graphical objects from the XODUS library 
which are manipulated using the same techniques described above.
The "form" is the graphical object which is used as a container for
all other graphical items. Thus, before making a graph we need to make a 
form to put it in which we will arbitrarily name <i>/data</i>.


<PRE>
    create xform /data
</PRE>

<P>
You may have noticed that nothing much seemed to happen. By default, forms
are hidden when first created. To reveal the newly created form use the
command

<PRE>
    xshow /data
</PRE>

<P>
An empty box should appear somewhere on your screen. 
To create a graph in this form with the name <i>voltage</i> use the command

<PRE>
    create xgraph /data/voltage
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the graph was created beneath the form in the element hierarchy.
This is quite important, as the hierarchy is used to define the nesting of 
the displayed graphical elements.

<P>

<H2>Linking Elements</H2>

<P> Now you have a cell with a soma, and a graph, but you need some way of
passing information from one to the other.

<P>
Inter-element communication within GENESIS is achieved through a system of
links called <i>messages</i>. Messages allow one element to access the data
fields of another element. For example to cause the graph to display the
voltage of the cell you must first pass a message from the cell to the graph
indicating that you would like a particular data field to be plotted. This
is done using the command  


<PRE>
    addmsg /cell/soma /data/voltage PLOT Vm *volts *red
</PRE>

<P>
The first two arguments give it the source and destination elements. The
third argument tells it what type of message you are sending. In this case
the message is a request to plot the contents of the fourth argument which
is the name of the data field in the cell which you wish to be plotted.
The last two arguments give the label and color to be used in plotting this
field.  You can now run the simulation and view the results in the graph.


<PRE>
    reset
    step 100
</PRE>


<P>
Note that to plot another field in the same graph, just send another
message 


<PRE>
    addmsg /cell/soma /data/voltage PLOT inject *current *blue
    reset
    step 100
</PRE>

<P>
and you are displaying current and voltage.

<P>

<H2>Adding Buttons to a Form</H2>

<P>
The <b>xbutton</b> graphical element is often used to invoke a function when a
mouse button is clicked.  Give the command 


<PRE>
    create xbutton /data/RESET -script reset
</PRE>

<P>
This should cause a bar labeled <TT>RESET</TT> to appear within the "data"
form below the "voltage" graph.  When the mouse is moved so that the cursor
is within the bar and the left mouse button is clicked, the function
following the argument <TT>-script</TT> is invoked.  Now add another button
to the form with the command

<PRE>
    create xbutton /data/RUN -script "step 100"
</PRE>
<P>

<P>
In this case, the function to be executed has a parameter (the number of
steps), so <TT>"step 100"</TT> must be enclosed in quotes so that the
argument of <TT>-script</TT> will be treated as a single string.

<P>
At this stage, you have a complete GENESIS simulation which may be run by
clicking the left mouse button on the bar labeled <TT>RESET</TT> and then
on the one labeled <TT>RUN</TT>.  To terminate the simulation and leave
GENESIS, type either <TT>quit</TT> or <TT>exit</TT>.  If you like, you may
implement one of these commands with a button also.

<P>
At this time, you should use an editor to create a script containing the
GENESIS commands which were used to construct this simulation.  The script
should begin with 


<PRE>
//genesis
</PRE>

<P>
and the filename should have the extension ".g".   For example, if the
script were named <i>tutorial1.g</i>, you could create the objects and set
up the messages with the GENESIS command


<PRE>
    tutorial1
</PRE>

<P>
If you have exited GENESIS and are back at the unix prompt, you may run
GENESIS and bring up the simulation with the single command 


<PRE>
    genesis tutorial1
</PRE>
