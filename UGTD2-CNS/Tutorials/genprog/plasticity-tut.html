<P>
<A HREF="synchan-tut.html">Making synaptic connections</A> briefly
mentioned the synapse substructure of of the syhchan. Each synaptic
connection to a synchan (established with a SPIKE message) has fields
for the synaptic weight, and for a delay.  The delay field is used in
network models to represent axonal conduction delays that typically
depend on distance. The effect of this field is to impose a delay on
the arrival of spikes from a synapse.

<P>

<B>Example:</B>

<PRE>
  addmsg /cell1/soma/spike /cell2/dend/Ex_channel SPIKE
  setfield /cell2/dend/Ex_channel synapse[0].weight 10 synapse[0].delay 0.005
</PRE>
<P>

Similar statements would be used for additional synaptic connections
synapse[1], synapse[2], etc. The key to implementing synaptic plasticity
is to modify the value of the synapse weight field while the simulation
is running, according to some model of synaptic plasticity.

<P>

One way to do this is with variants of the synchan object that have
the plasticity mechanism built in to them. This is the case with the
hebbsynchan and facsynchan objects, or custom objects created
according to 
<A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual-21.html#ss21.3"> Creating New Synaptic
Objects</A>.  However, these objects are not hsolvable, and cannot be
used in cells that have been taken over by hsolve. The VAnet2
simulation in <A HREF="../networks/VAnet2/README.html">networks/VAnet2</A>
illustrates how the use of hsolve can increase the speed of a large
network simulation as much as a factor of 20.

<P>
The alternative that is consistent with hsolve is to perform the
weight changes with a clocked object or function that is external to
the hsolved network. This can be done by either

<UL>
  <LI>writing a script function that performs the weight change, and is called
with a "../Doc/script_out.txt" script_out element

  <LI>using a compiled GENESIS object, such as the stdp_rules object to
  perform the update.

</UL>
<P>
For details of the implementation, see the GENESIS 2.4 documentation
<A HREF= "../Hyperdoc/Manual-21.html#ss21.4"> Creating New Synaptic Plasticity
Objects</A>. There is also a tutorial with example scripts in
<A HREF="htmlScripts/stdp_rules/README.html">Scripts/stdp_rules</A>.
This tutorial illustrates both methods as applied to the the Song,
Miller, and Abbott (SMA) model for Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity
(STDP).
