<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Implementing synaptic plasticity</A></H1>

<P>
<A HREF="synchan-tut.html">Making synaptic connections</A> briefly
mentioned the synapse substructure of of the syhchan. Each synaptic
connection to a synchan (established with a SPIKE message) has fields
for the synaptic weight, and for a delay.  The delay field is used in
network models to represent axonal conduction delays that typically
depend on distance. The effect of this field is to impose a delay on
the arrival of spikes from a synapse.

<P>

<B>Example:</B>

<PRE>
  addmsg /cell1/soma/spike /cell2/dend/Ex_channel SPIKE
  setfield /cell2/dend/Ex_channel synapse[0].weight 10 synapse[0].delay 0.005
</PRE>
<P>

Similar statements would be used for additional synaptic connections
synapse[1], synapse[2], etc. The key to implementing synaptic plasticity
is to modify the value of the synapse weight field while the simulation
is running, according to some model of synaptic plasticity.

<P>

One way to do this is with variants of the synchan object that have
the plasticity mechanism built in to them. This is the case with the
<B>hebbsynchan</B> and <B>facsynchan objects</B>, or custom objects
created according to
<A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual-21.html#ss21.3"> Creating New Synaptic
Objects</A>.  However, these objects are not hsolvable, and cannot be
used in cells that have been taken over by <B>hsolve</B>. The <I>VAnet2</I>
simulation in <A HREF="../networks/VAnet2/README.html">networks/VAnet2</A>
illustrates how the use of hsolve can increase the speed of a large
network simulation by as much as a factor of 20.

<P>
An alternative that is consistent with hsolve is to perform the
weight changes with a clocked object or function that is external to
the hsolved network. This can be done by either

<UL>
  <LI>writing a script function that performs the weight change, and is called
with a "../Doc/script_out.txt" script_out element

  <LI>using a compiled GENESIS object, such as the <B>stdp_rules</B> object to
  perform the update.

</UL>

<P>

The tutorial with example scripts in
<A HREF="htmlScripts/stdp_rules/README.html">Scripts/stdp_rules</A>
illustrates both methods as applied to the the Song, Miller, and
Abbott (2000) (SMA) model for Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP).

<P>

The concept behind the <B>stdp_rules</B> object is very general, but
this particular implementation is specific to the SMA phenomenological
model of STDP. Rather than using a more biologically based model that
depends on calcium influx to the cell, the weight modification rules
are based on experimentally observed relationships between the timing
of pre and postsynaptic spikes, e.g. Dan and Poo (2004).  The GENESIS
implementation has been adapted for compartmental models with
continous conductance changes, Hodgkin-Huxley channels, and axonal
delays, rather than for 'point neuron' integrate and fire (IF) cells.

<P>
The demonstration script <I>Scripts/stdp_rules/W32ex-5-1-batch.g</I> defines a
function <I>apply_stdp_rules</I> that illustrates the SMA application of the SMA
weight update procedure in the GENESIS scripting language.  It is called by a
<B>script_out</B> element at 1 msec intervals.  The
function <I>setup_stdp_update</I> shows how to more rapidly perform
the same weight modification rules by creating and initializing the
fields of a <B>stdp_rules</B> element.

<P>
There are exercises in the application of the <B>stdp_rules</B> object in
 <A HREF= "../exercises/course-tutorials.html">course-tutorials.html</A>
and in  <A HREF= "../exercises/Gtut5.html">Gtut5.html</A>
in the <I>exercises</I> directory.
