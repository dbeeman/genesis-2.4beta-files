<H2>Building a cell the easy way</H2>

<P>
Now that we know how to make a realistic neural compartment, the next
steps in creating a realistic model of a neuron are to:


<OL>
  <LI> Set the passive membrane parameters (membrane resistance and
  capacitance, axial resistance, and membrane resting potential (Rm, Cm,
  Ra, and Ek) for each of the compartments.

  <LI> Populate the compartments with ionic conductances ("channels"), or other
  related neural elements.

  <LI> Link compartments for the soma and dendrites together with appropriate
  messages to make a cell.


</OL>
<P>

The <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">Book of GENESIS</A> gradually builds up to
the creation of a cell the "hard way" in Chapter 14 and Chapter 15, describing
the element fields that need to be set and the messages that need to be
established between the elements.  It then describes an easier way in Chapter
16 that uses the GENESIS cell reader to perform these three steps.

<P>

This tutorial jumps ahead to create a cell "the easy way", using the cell
reader. Whether you use the cell reader, or whether you constract it "the
hard way" using scripting commands to set up the messages that link its
elements, it is necessary to understand how messages are used in GENESIS.
The detour <A HREF="tut3-4-lite.html">Building a cell without the cell
reader</A> describes and illustrates the use of messages to build a
similar cell "the hard way".  You may read it either before or after this
section of the tutorial.  In particular, you should come back to it if
you should find yourself uncertain about the way to properly set up
a message to pass information between two GENESIS elements.

<P>
<b>Detour:</b> <A HREF="tut3-4-lite.html">Building a cell without the cell
reader - Using GENESIS messages</A>.
<P>
Now, let's plunge ahead and create a simple neuron with the cell reader.
When you have finished, return to follow the link above in order to see how
these steps would be done using separate GENESIS commands.  This will help
you to understand what the cell reader is doing, and the messages that it
sets up between the elements that make up a cell model.

<P>
In this part of the tutorial we will use the cell reader to create a simple
two-compartment neuron with a dendrite compartment, a soma, and an axon.
The dendrite contains synaptically activated excitatory and inhibitory
channels and the soma contains voltage-activated Hodgkin-Huxley
sodium and potassium channels, plus a <b>spikegen</b> element that
acts like the intial part of an axon.  This may be used to provide synaptic
input to another cell.

<P>
Locate the "GENESIS Tutorials directory"
that contains the GENESIS tutorials and "cd" to it in
a terminal window.  "ls" will show you that it contains a <i>cells</i>
directory, which contains other directories having various GENESIS cell
models.  To begin, "cd" to the directory <i>cells/simplecell</i> and run
the <i>simplecell</i> simulation by typing "<tt>genesis simplecell</tt>".
You may vary the injection current (given in Amperes) from the default
value of 0.5 nA, by editing the value in the "Injection" dialog box.  NOTE:
after entering a value in a GENESIS dialog box, you must hit the "Enter"
key for the value to be accepted.  Experiment with the simulation, and the
effect of the RESET and "Overlay" toggle button after changing the
injection current.  Notice that the "scale" button on the graph lets you
change the scales for graph axes.


<P>
Now, it's time to understand the <i>simplecell.g</i> script, which contains
only:

<PRE>
//genesis  -  simplecell.g
/*======================================================================
  A sample script to create a neuron containing channels taken from
  hh_tchan.g in the neurokit prototypes library.  SI units are used.
  ======================================================================*/

</PRE>
<P>
The statement "<tt>include protodefs</tt>" merges in the contents of the
<i>protodefs.g</i> file, which is in the current (<i>cells/simplecell</i>)
directory.  This file, which we will examine shortly, creates the prototype
compartment and channels, from which the cell reader will construct our
cell.

<P>
The included file, <i>graphics.g</i>, contains the definition of the
functions <i>make_control</i> and <i>make_Vmgraph</i> that are used to make
the control panel and the graph for plotting the soma membrane potential
<i>Vm</i>.   

<P>
The cell is constructed with the single command

<PRE>
readcell cell.p /cell
</PRE>

<P>
which creates a <b>neutral</b> placeholder element <i>/cell</i> and builds the
cell under it, according to the specifications in the cell parameter file
<i>cell.p</i>:

<PRE>
// cell.p - Cell parameter file used in the simplecell tutorial

//	Format of file :
// x,y,z,dia are in microns, all other units are SI (Meter Kilogram Sec Amp)
// In polar mode 'r' is in microns, theta and phi in degrees

</PRE>

<P>
The comments in the file give a brief description of the format of a cell
parameter file, and further details are given in the documentation for <a
href="textDoc/readcell.doc.txt">readcell</a>.  The <i>readcell</i> options
used here specify that relative cartesian coordinates will be used with
asymmetric compartments.  (If the option "<tt>*symmetric</tt>" had been
used, then the cell would be constructed using <a
href="textDoc/symcompartment.doc.txt">symcompartment</a> elements.)

<P>
This means that for lines such as

<PRE>
soma  none   30  0  0  30
dend  soma  100  0  0   2
</PRE>

<P>
the soma, which is the start of the cell and has no parent, has its end at
the (x, y, z) coordinates of (30, 0, 0) in micrometers.  As the cell starts
at (0, 0, 0), this means that the soma has a length of 30 micrometers and a
diameter of 30 micrometers.  The "dend" section will be connected to its
parent, the soma, through its own axial resistance Ra, with suitable
messages established between the two compartments.  As relative coordinates
are being used, the end of the dendrite compartment will lie 100
micrometers along the x-axis from the end of of the soma compartment.

<P>
With the simplecell simulation running, give these commands to the genesis
prompt:

<PRE>
showfield /cell/soma -all
showfield /cell/dend -all
</PRE>

<P>
The "<tt>-all</tt>" option causes the compartment start (x0, y0, z0) and
end (x, y, z) coordinates to be displayed, along with the length and
diameter and other compartment fields.  Verify that these values are what
you would expect.

<P>
For a more interesting example of 9-compartment cell with branching basal
dendrites, see the cell parameter file <a
href="textScripts/cells/corticalcells/layer5.p.txt">
cells/corticalcells/layer5.p</a>.


<P>
In the <a href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial2.g.txt">tutorial2.g</a>
script, the specific membrane parameters RM, CM, and RA were declared and
given values.  The <i>makecompartment</i> function was used to calculate
and set the proper values of the fields Rm, Cm, and Ra using these
parameters and the compartment length and diameter.  Here, this is all done
by the cell reader, using the values of RM, RA, and CM that were specified
using the "<tt>*set_compt_param</tt>" option and the compartment
coordinates and diameter.  You can verify that this was correctly done, by
using the <i>showfield</i> commands above.

<P>
<i>tutorial2.g</i> also defined the resting potential of the compartment
EREST_ACT, but set the soma compartment Em field to a different value,
"<tt>Eleak = EREST_ACT + 0.0106</tt>".  Normally, we would expect to set
this field, which represents the "battery" in series with the membrane
resistance Rm, to the value of EREST_ACT.  However, Hodgin and Huxley found
it necessary to set Em to a leakage potential Eleak that compensates for
current flow through other channels (such as chloride channels) which were
not explicitly taken into account in their model.  Eleak is set to a value
that results in no net current flow when the cell is at EREST_ACT.  The
cell reader takes care of this by not only setting EREST_ACT to the value
specified in the cell parameter file, but allowing the use of another
parameter ELEAK, which if specified, gives an alternate value Em, but
allows Vm to be initialized to EREST_ACT on reset, instead of Em.  (For
further details of the initializaton of Vm on reset, see the documentation
for <a href="textDoc/compartment.doc.txt">compartment</a>.)

<P>
Therefore, the cell parameter file above sets ELEAK to EREST_ACT + 0.0106
for the soma, but sets it to EREST_ACT for the dendrite.

<P>
Finally, note the list of channels and their conductance densities that
follow the compartment coordinates and diameter.  For the soma, these are
the values used by Hodgkin and Huxley for the squid giant axon, with the
sodium channel (<i>Na_hh_tchan</i>) given a maximum conductance of 1200
Siemens per square meter of surface area, and the potassium channel
(<i>K_hh_tchan</i>) given a value of 300 S/m^2.  The cell reader scales
these by the surface area to set the "Gbar" fields of the channel elements,
and also sets up the necessary messages between the channels and the
compartment that contains them.

<P> Although the simplecell simulation does not make use of them, the dendrite
compartment has been given excitatory and inhibitory synaptically activated
channels, with appropriate conductance densities.  A later section of the
tutorial describes how these, and the spike generator element <i>spike</i>
that was created in the soma, can be used when this cell is connected to
another in a circuit or network.  (If you want a preview, take a look at the
documentation for <A HREF="textDoc/synchan.doc.txt">synchan</A>, <A
HREF="textDoc/spikegen.doc.txt">spikegen</A>, and the <A
HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html"> GENESIS Reference Manual</A> section on
Synaptic Connections).

<P>
To see the messages that have been set up by the cell reader (plus the
PLOT message established by <i>simplecell.g</i>), give the commands

<PRE>
showmsg /cell/soma
showmsg /cell/dend
</PRE>

<H2>Creating channel prototypes</H2>

<P>
The remaining thing to be explained is the way that we tell the cell reader
about the properties of the elements that the cell parameter file calls
<tt>Na_hh_tchan</tt>, <tt>K_hh_tchan</tt>, <tt>spike</tt>,
<tt>Ex_channel</tt>, and <tt>Inh_channel</tt>.  If you are anxious to go on
to connect cells together in a network, you can skip ahead to the section
on <a href="synchan-tut.html">Making synaptic connections</a> and return to
this part later.  However, at some point, you will need to create these
prototype channels.

<P>
The cell reader builds the cell by making copies of "prototypes" of the
various elements that will be used, replacing the default values of
parameter fields with values taken from the cell descriptor file.  For
example, when constructing a soma with several attached dendrite
compartments, it will make multiple copies of a generic compartment
prototype and then set the data fields in each compartment to the
appropriate values.  Likewise, a cell having Hodgkin-Huxley Na channels in
several compartments will get these channels from copies of the single Na
channel prototype, setting the value of the maximum channel conductance
Gbar for each copy, making use of the specified conductance density and
dimensions of the compartment that contains the channel.

<P>
The cell reader expects to find this library of prototype elements as a set
of subelements of the neutral element <i>/library</i>.  Thus, we need to
write a script that will create <i>/library</i> and fill it with a
prototype compartment, one copy of each of the different channel types we
will use, and a spike generator.  Although the statements that are needed
to set up the prototype library could go into your main simulation script,
it is customary to make a separate script for this, and to then use
<i>include</i> to bring it into the simulation.  This script is often
called <i>protodefs.g</i>, although you may give it any name that you like
in your own simulations.

<P>
At this point, examine the listing for
<a href="textScripts/cells/simplecell/protodefs.g.txt">protodefs.g</a>.

<P>
Note the use of several statements to include the files
<a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/compartments.g.txt">
compartments.g</a>,
<a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/hh_tchan.g.txt">
hh_tchan.g</a>,
<a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/synchans.g.txt">
synchans.g</a>, and
<a href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/protospike.g.txt">
protospike.g</a>.

<P>
These files are not in the <i>cells/simplecell</i> directory, but are
found in the <i>genesis/Scripts/neurokit/prototypes</i> directory.  The
GENESIS initialization file (<i>.simrc</i> in your home directory) sets the
GENESIS search path (SIMPATH) to include this directory, so that these and
many other files with prototype definitions can be accessed from any
directory.

<P>
These files contain definitions of some global variables for channel
reversal potentials and the like, plus function definitions that create
create the prototype elements.  For example, <i>hh_tchan.g</i> sets some
default values for the cell resting potential EREST_ACT, the sodium
reversal potential ENa, and the potassium reversal potential EK.  It also
declares the functions <i>make_Na_hh_tchan</i> and <i>make_K_hh_tchan</i>
to make the Na and K channel elements.  The <i>protodefs.g</i> file assigns
different values to these variables <b>after</b> <i>hh_tchan.g</i> is
included, but <b>before</b> the functions that create the prototype
channels are called.

<P>
Usually the file containing the functions to create prototype channels will
have some means of shifting the voltage scale for activation and time constant
curves (minf and tau) by specifying a variable for the voltage offset in
equations that depend on the membrane potential.  Often the variable EREST_ACT
is used for this purpose, as it can also represent the nominal resting
potential of the cell for which the active channel models were developed.  By
using this as a global variable and changing it before calling the channel
creation functions that are defined in the channel files, you can shift these
curves.  This can be very useful when you use a channel developed for one cell
model in different cell.

<P>
<b>WARNING:</b> Note that EREST_ACT is also used in the cell parameter file to
give Em and the starting Vm (initVm).  And, if you include more than one file
with functions to create channels, these files may set different values for
EREST_ACT or the ionic reversal potentials.  If this is the case, you should
be careful to reset these variables to the desired values, <b>after</b>
including the file, and <b>before</b> invoking the channel creation functions
defined in that file.

<P>
<b>Detour:</b> <a href="chantut.html">Creating your own channel models</a>

<P>

<H2>Creating the graphics</H2>

<P>
The file <a href="textScripts/cells/simplecell/graphics.g.txt">graphics.g</a>
can be used somewhat blindly, as long as you are happy with the default
control panel and the graph that it creates.  After including it, all you
need to do is to invoke the <i>make_control</i> and <i>make_Vmgraph</i>
functions and to send appropriate PLOT messages to the <i>/data/voltage</i>
xgraph element.

<P>
It is a good idea to keep the commands that involve graphics in a separate
file, as we have done here.  If you should later want to modify your
simulation to run without graphics, as you might want to do when making
long simulation runs on another networked computer, then you only need to
make small changes to to the main simulation script.  This will also allow
you to easily add alternate Java-based user interfaces when GENESIS 3 is
available.

<P>
In future tutorials, we will build upon the <i>simplecell</i> model scripts
to create more detailed cell models.  There is also a much fancier version
of this simulation in the <i>cells/simplecell2</i> directory.  This
implements the same model neuron, but provides a fancier graphical
interface with controls to allow pulsed injection current, synaptic input
from spike trains, and random Poisson-distributed background synaptic
activation.  It also provides user-defined string variables in the main
script that you can change to use with different cell models.
The <A HREF="textScripts/cells/simplecell2/README.txt">README</A> file for
the <i>simplecell2</i> model tells more about the simulation.

<P> If you need to modify this file for your own customized GUI, refer to the
<A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">GENESIS Reference Manual</A> section on the
XODUS Graphical Interface, and the links given there for documentation for the
XODUS "widgets" xbutton, xtoggle, xlabel, and xgraph.  Chapter 14 of the <A
HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> also explains some of the XODUS commands
that were used to create a similar interface for <a
href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial3.g.txt">tutorial3.g</a>, and  
Chapter 22 gives a very detailed treatment of XODUS.

<P>
Some of the GENESIS features used in the
 <a href="textScripts/cells/simplecell/graphics.g.txt">graphics.g</a>
 file, and explained in the documentation links are:

<UL>
  <LI> the use of a function <i>overlaytoggle</i>, that uses an xtoggle
widget to set the overlay field of all <b>xgraph</b> objects, so that a new
graph can be plotted after a reset, without clearing the graph.  This is
used with the <b>xtoggle</b> element that is created in
<i>make_control</i>, to toggle back and forth between overlay mode and
non-overlay mode.

  <LI> The use of the wildcard expression "<tt>/##[TYPE=xgraph]</tt>" to mean
any element in the element tree that is created from an <b>xgraph</b> object.
The wildcard notation is explained in the <A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">
GENESIS Reference Manual</A> section on Hierarchical Structure.

  <LI> The use of the <i>getfield</i> command to return the value of a
field of an <b>xtoggle</b>, <b>xdialog</b>, or any other element.

  <LI> The specification of position and dimensions [x, y, width, height]
for xforms.

  <LI> The use of various ways of sizing and positioning of widgets, and
setting labels and background colors.  You may wish to experiment with
these options.

  <LI> The use of a <b>xdialog</b> widget with a label, default value
string, and function to be executed (the "-script" argument).  Note the use
of the shorthand "&lt;widget&gt;" to refer to the widget itself, which in
this case is the xdialog <i>/control/Injection</i>.

  <LI> The use of the XUnits and YUnits fields of an xgraph to add labels
to graph X and Y axes.

  <LI> The use of the function <i>makegraphscale</i> (defined in the
included file <a href="textScripts/cells/xtools.g.txt">xtools.g</a>) to
create a "scale" button in the upper left corner of a graph, for changing
axis scales.


</UL>
<P>
<b>An exercise</b> (highly recommended):

<P>
Build some more cell simulations using the <i>graphics.g</i> file provided
here, your own modified version of <i>simplecell.g</i>, and with the
channel prototypes and cell parameter files found in some of the
subdirectories of the <i>cells</i> directory.  The <i>corticalcells</i>
examples are a good place to start.  The <i>traubcell</i> subdirectory has
most of what you need to construct the 1991 Traub hippocampal CA3 region
pyramidal cell model.  Each of these subdirectories of <i>cells</i> has a
README file with further information.

<P>
For this, it would be best to create your own directory to which you will
copy the files that you will modify for your simulation.  For example,
assuming that you want to create a subdirectory in your home directory
called <i>newcell</i> and it doesn't already exist, you might do the
following from within the <i>cells</i> subdirectory of the "GENESIS
Tutorials" directory:

<pre>
mkdir ~/newcell
cp simplecell/* ~/newcell
cp corticalcells/* ~/newcell
cd ~/newcell
</pre>

<P>
You can then use your favorite text editor to modify any of these files.

<P>
<b>Another exercise</b>:

<P>
The <i>genesis/Scripts/neurokit/prototypes</i> file <a
href="textScripts/neurokit/prototypes/yamadachan.g.txt"><i>yamadachan.g</i></a>
contains a function <i>make_KM_bsg_yka</i> to generate a Non-inactivating
Muscarinic K current.  This conductance was used in a model of a bullfrog
stomatogastric ganglion cell, by Yamada, Koch, and Adams (Methods in
Neuronal Modeling, 1st edition, Koch and Segev editors, MIT Press 1989).

<P>
This slow hyperpolarizing current is responsible for spike frequency adaption.
i.e., after a current injection causes the cell to begin firing, the spiking
rate decreases and reaches a steady slower rate, as in the plot shown below.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><img src="images/simplecell-M.gif">

<P>
Your task is to add a <i>KM_bsg_yka</i> to the simplecell model.  Use the
same K reversal potential EK as used by the <i>K_hh_tchan</i> channel.  Chose
conductance densities that achieve a result similar to the one above, when
the injection current is 0.5 nA (as with the simplecell simulation).  HINT:
Keep the <i>Na_hh_tchan</i> maximum conductance density at its original
value of 1200 S/m^2, but you will need to lower the <i>K_hh_tchan</i>
maximum conductance considerably in order to compensate for the
hyperpolarization contributed by <i>KM_bsg_yka</i>.  If either of these
potassium conductances are too large, the cell will not continue to fire.
It will take a careful balance between them to produce the right result.

<P>

I give up -- tell me what conductance densities to use.</b></a>

Next, we will learn how to add synaptically activated channels and make
