<H1>Making more realistic cell models</H1>
<P>

<H2>Why bother?</H2>
<P>
Jim Bower has discussed the value of structurally realistic modeling
in his introductory remarks on WAM-BAMM and the modeling philosophy
behind the GENESIS approach to modeling  (Bower 2005).
You can also read his thoughts on choosing the level of detail to use in
modeling in <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> Chapter 11.

<P> The simple cell model that we have been using so far, described in <A
HREF="simplecell-tut.html">Building a cell the easy way</A>, fires at a steady
rate, with equal intervals between spikes.  With the addition of a
non-inactivating muscarinic potassium current, it was possible to produce a
non-uniform firing pattern with spike frequency adaptation.  The RScell
simulation in the <i>cells/RScell</i> directory is another simple
one-compartment model that has a somewhat more realistic firing pattern.
(See the <A HREF="textScripts/cells/RScell/README.txt">README</A> file for
the RScell model for more details.)

<P>
We might ask, how important is it to accurately reproduce the firing pattern of a
typical pyramidal cell when picking a cell model to use in a cortical network?
What is the effect of the spike latency and initial interspike interval (ISI) vs.
the final ISI in determining the behavior of a network of neurons that display
spike frequency adaptation?  Is the <i>RScell</i> model good enough to use in a
realistic network model?

<P>
Current clamp experiments on neocortical pyramidal cells often show results
similar to the simulation results below (generated from the detailed BDK5cell
simulation in the <i>cells/corticalcells</i> directory).  Is it necessary that
a model neuron used in a large network accurately fit the timing of these
action potentials?  Or will the large variation in properties of individual
neurons somehow "wash out" these details in the network, and allow us to use
much simpler models?  This is still an open question that may be answered by
further modeling studies.  However, there are indications that this variable
spike timing can significantly affect network behavior.

<P>

Here T<sub>0</sub> is the spike latency, or time between the application of
the injection pulse and the first spike.  Under conditions of low excitation,
this could act as an additional propagation delay, and affect the behavior of
the network.  The increasing interspike intervals T<sub>1</sub> -
T<sub>5</sub> can also affect the behavior of the network.  Under conditions
of high excitation, when the neuron is firing nearly continously, the later
intervals will be more relevant than the early ones.

<P>
Spike frequency adaption may also be used as a mechanism for processing
behaviorally relevant stimuli in the presence of many other sources of
synaptic input.  For example , Benda et al. (2005) have presented evidence
that spike frequency adaption is used as a high pass filter to separate
transient signals from slower oscillatory signals in the electrosensory
system of weakly electric fish.

<H2>Building the model</H2>

<P>
The electronically published version of the WAM-BAMM 2005 <A
HREF="../advanced-tutorials/index.html">Advanced Tutorial</A> on Realistic
Single Cell Modeling (Jaeger, 2005) may be viewed or downloaded at
<A HREF="http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/222">
http://www.brains-minds-media.org/archive/222</A>.
It presents a detailed account of the process of using experimental
data to create a realistic single neuron model.

<P>
To briefly summarize, the process consists of three main steps:

<OL>

<LI>Build a suitably realistic passive cell model, without the variable
conductances.  This subject is treated briefly in the
Introduction to GENESIS section on
<A HREF="../genesis-intro/genesis-intro.html#passive_cell">
Constructing the passive cell</A>, and in detail by Jaeger (2005).
Holmes et al. (2006) discuss issues that one encounters when determining
passive parameters for a model using physiological data and morphogical
data from different sources.

<P>

<LI>Add voltage and/or calcium activated conductances.  See
<A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> Chapter 7 for
an overview of the various types of ionic conductances, such as calcium
conductances, calcium-activated potassium
conductances, and inactivating potassium conductances,
and how they affect firing properties

<P>

<LI>Tune the model to better fit passive properties and channel parameters
that are known only approximately from experiment.  Chapter 7 of the <A
HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A> describes how the cell and channel
editing features of Neurokit may be used to perform manual parameter searches.
The <A HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html"> GENESIS Reference Manual</A> section on
the GENESIS Parameter Search Library and the example scripts in
<i>genesis/Scripts/param</i> describe powerful methods for performing
automated parameter searches in GENESIS.  The WAM-BAMM 2005 Advanced Tutorial
on Parameter Searching Tools in GENESIS at <A
HREF="http://www.wam-bamm.org/WB05/Tutorials">
http://www.wam-bamm.org/WB05/Tutorials</A> gives a good overview of parameter
searching and a discussion of the issues involved, suggestions, hints, and
pitfalls.
