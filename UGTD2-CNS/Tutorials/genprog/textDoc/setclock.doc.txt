Routine Name:	setclock

Description:	Sets time interval (step size) associated with specified clock.

Usage:		setclock clock-number value

Example:	setclock 0 0.01     // simulation time step in msec
		setclock 1 0.05     // plotting interval can be larger

		genesis >  setclock 0 5.5
		changing clock [0] from 1 to 5.5

Notes:		The setclock routine is used to set the current value
		assigned to the time increment for one of the GENESIS
		simulator clocks.  These clocks are updated each time a step
		is performed.

		Clock number 0 is the default clock used by each element to
		determine how often it should perform a simulation step.  When
		components of a simulation run at significantly different time
		scales, it may be useful to use other clocks (specified with
		useclock) having different time intervals.
