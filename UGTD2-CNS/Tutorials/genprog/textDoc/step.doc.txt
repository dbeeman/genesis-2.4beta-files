Routine Name:	step

Description:	Advances the simulation by one or more steps.

Usage:		step [steps-or-time] -time -verbose -background

		steps		number of steps to advance simulation

		time		time by which to advance simulation

		-time		interpret the first argument as time

		-verbose	use verbose mode (display status of simulation
				at each step)

		-background	run simulation as background process, and
				return user to GENESIS shell

Example:	step 100
		step 5 -v
		step 25.4 -t -b

		genesis >  step
		time = 1.000000 ; step = 1
		completed 1 steps in 0.000000 cpu seconds

Notes:		When run in the background, the simulation is still sensitive
		to ^C.  Generating a ^C interrupt can cause the simulation to
		abnormally terminate a step giving erroneous results.  To halt
		an simulation in progress, use the stop routine.

		Only one simulation can be started at any given time. A
		background simulation must already be running. The showjobs
		routine will display this status (as the Simulate function).
