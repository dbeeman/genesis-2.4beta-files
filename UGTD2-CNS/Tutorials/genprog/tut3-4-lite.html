<H1>Building a cell without the cell reader</H1>
<H2>Using GENESIS messages</H2>
<P>
GENESIS messages were introduced in <A HREF="tutorial1.html">A Basic
Tutorial on GENESIS</A> as a way of linking elements.   The simulation
script <a href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial1.g.txt">tutorial1.g</a>
uses the <a href="textDoc/addmsg.txt">addmsg</a>
command to pass the membrane potential of the soma
to a graph, using a PLOT message.

<P>
Messages are used to establish persistent connections between elements
to send information that may change with time.  The 
<a href="textDoc/addmsg.txt">addmsg</a> command has the form

<PRE>
          addmsg source-element dest-delement msg-type [msg-fields]
</PRE>

<P> Here, the source element sends the value(s) of one or more of its
fields (the "msg-fields" parameters) to the destination element.  At each
step of its simulation clock, the destination element acts on the data that
is sent, according to the name of the message (the "msg-type").  In order
to properly set up a message with <i>addmsg</i>, you need to look at the
documentation for the object type used to create the source element, in
order to find out the names of the fields that exist and can be sent.  Then
you need to look at the documentation for the object type of the
destination element in order to find out what types of messages it is
capable of receiving, and what parameters it expects to receive in the
message.  The <i>addmsg</i> command should send the corresponding field
values of the source element in the proper order.

<P>

For example, <i>/cell</i> is made from a <b>neutral</b> object and
<i>/cell/soma</i> is created from a <b>compartment object</b>.  According
to the documentation for <a href="textDoc/compartment.txt">compartment</a>,
it can receive the messages:

<PRE>
                CHANNEL Gk Ek   delivers the conductance and equilibrium
                                potential of channel within the compartment
                RAXIAL Ra Vm    delivers the Ra and Vm of a compartment
                AXIAL Vm        delivers the Vm of a compartment
                INJECT inject   sets the inject field to the message value
                EREST Em        sets the Em  field to the message value
</PRE>
<P>
The CHANNEL message is sent from a channel (ionic conductance) to enable
the compartment to calculate the current flowing into the compartment
through the channel.  RAXIAL and AXIAL are used to pass information from
adjacent compartments in order to calculate current flow between the
compartments.  Some messaages, such as INJECT and EREST, simply set the
value of fields in the destination element, so that they will be available
for calculations during the next processing step.

<P> The <a href="textDoc/funcgen.txt">funcgen</a> object implements a
function generator that produces periodic output.  It has various fields
for setting the waveform (sine, square, triangular, or constant),
frequency, amplitude, phase, and offset.  The output waveform appears as
the value of the "output" field.

<P> A funcgen element could be used to provide regular trains of injection
current pulses to <i>/cell/soma</i> with an INJECT message, with these
commands:

<PRE>
    create funcgen /funky
    // Set it for a square wave of 0.5 nA amplitude, and frequency of 10 Hz.
    setfield /funky mode 0 amplitude 0.5e-9 frequency 10
    addmsg /funky /cell/soma INJECT output
</PRE>

<P>

Note that the name of the parameter sent with the INJECT message is
"output" (a field of the source element) , not "inject".  This message will
send the value of output and use it to set the value of inject in the
destination element.

<P>
The <a href="textDoc/pulsegen.txt">pulsegen</a> object provides a more
general purpose pulse generator.
The <i>simplecell2</i> simulation in the <i>cells/simplecell2</i> directory
uses a <b>pulsegen</b> to provide injection pulses with control over
onset delay, pulse width, and interval.
The <A HREF="textScripts/cells/simplecell2/README.txt">README</A> file for
the <i>simplecell2</i> model tells more about the simulation.

<H2>Linking parts of the cell with messages</H2>

Chapter 14 of the BoG develops the script <a
href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial3.g.txt">tutorial3.g</a> to add
Hodgkin-Huxley Na and K channels to the single soma compartment that was
created in <a href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial2.g.txt">tutorial2.g</a>.
The newer version <a href="textScripts/tutorials/newtutorial3.g.txt">
newtutorial3.g</a> is similar, but uses the preferred <b>tabchannel</b>
object.

<P>
In either case, the channel is created by calling a function in
an included file, as described in the 
"<a href="simplecell-tut.html">Building a cell the easy way</a>"
tutorial.  However, instead of using the cell reader to put the channels in
the right place in the element hierarchy and to connect them to the soma,
the scripts use statements like:

<PRE>
// Create two channels, "/cell/soma/Na_squid_hh" and "/cell/soma/K_squid_hh"
pushe /cell/soma
make_Na_hh_tchan
make_K_hh_tchan
pope

// The soma needs to know the value of the channel conductance
// and equilibrium potential in order to calculate the current
// through the channel.  The channel calculates its conductance
// using the current value of the soma membrane potential.

addmsg /cell/soma/Na_hh_tchan /cell/soma CHANNEL Gk Ek
addmsg /cell/soma /cell/soma/Na_hh_tchan VOLTAGE Vm
addmsg /cell/soma/K_hh_tchan /cell/soma CHANNEL Gk Ek
addmsg /cell/soma /cell/soma/K_hh_tchan VOLTAGE Vm
</PRE>

In <a href="textScripts/tutorials/tutorial4.g.txt">tutorial4.g</a>,
developed in <A HREF="../iBoGpdf/index.html">BoG</A>
Chapter 15, a dendrite compartment is created, and then
connected to the soma with messages like this

<p>
<center>
<pre><b>/cell/soma                                                 /cell/dend</b></pre>
</center>

<p align=center><img src="images/comptmsg.gif">
<P>and the GENESIS statements

<PRE>
addmsg /cell/dend /cell/soma RAXIAL Ra previous_state
addmsg /cell/soma /cell/dend AXIAL  previous_state
</PRE>

<P>
In the first message, the dendrite compartment is linked to the soma with a
message of the type RAXIAL, and a message link is established whereby two
value fields, Ra and previous_state, will be sent from the dendrite to the
soma at each simulation step.  This allows the soma to calculate the
current entering from the dendrite compartment.  The previous_state field
gives the value of the membrane potential at the previous integration step.
We use this field rather than Vm because we want each compartment to update
its data fields using data from the previous simulation step.

<p>
This establishes the information flow from the dendrite to the soma. In the
reverse direction, the dendrite needs to receive the value of the soma's
previous membrane potential in order to update its own state. (The dendrite
already knows its own axial resistance to the soma, so the AXIAL message need
not include information regarding axial resistance.)

<P>
The section of this tutorial on <a href="synchan-tut.html">
Making synaptic connections</a>
describes the spike generator that the cell reader adds to the soma.
In <i>tutorial4.g</i>, this is accomplished with the statements:

<PRE>
// add a spike generator to the soma
create spikegen /cell/soma/spike
setfield /cell/soma/spike  thresh 0  abs_refract 0.010  output_amp 1
/* use the soma membrane potential to drive the spike generator */
addmsg  /cell/soma  {path}/soma/spike  INPUT Vm
</PRE>

<P> The use of the <b>spikegen</b> object is described in the <A
HREF="../Hyperdoc/Manual.html">GENESIS Reference Manual</A> section on
Synaptic Connections and in the documentation for the <a
href="textDoc/spikegen.doc.txt"> spikegen</a> object.
