<H1><A NAME="section-1">README - Getting started with GENESIS</A></H1>

<P> This README file tells you how to obtain, install, and run GENESIS and the
GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials package.  The main index to the tutorials is
<A HREF="index.html">here</A>.
<P>
If you are unfamilar with the UNIX command line environment, the short
<A HREF="unixhelp/unixhelp.html">Introduction to UNIX or Linux</A>
will help you understand the instructions below.

<H2>Installing GENESIS
</H2>
<P>

You may install the hypertext GENESIS Modeling Tutorials and the
supplementary material for the Advanced GENESIS Tutorials anywhere on your
computer, without installing GENESIS.  However, you will get the most
advantage from the tutorials if you install the GENESIS simulator first,
and install the Tutorials in the "genesis" directory.

<P> The first step is to download the latest GENESIS distribution from the
GENESIS Web site <A HREF="http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">
http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/</A>. If you are using Linux, Mac OS/X,
or Microsoft Windows with Cygwin (a UNIX-like environment for Windows), you
may download the appropriate GENESIS binary distribution that includes a
precompiled "<i>genesis</i>" executable file.  This will save you the
trouble of compiling GENESIS from the source code that is included with the
GENESIS source distribution.

<P> The GENESIS distribution may be installed in whatever directory is most
convenient.  You do not need "root" privileges to install within your home
directory.  On the other hand, if you want a system-wide installation,
<i>/usr/local</i> is a good place to install GENESIS.  The distributed
compressed tar file will have name like <i>genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz</i>,
or if it is a binary distribution, <i>genesis-2.4-linux-bin.tar.gz</i>.
It will unpack to produce the directory tree <i>genesis-2.4/genesis</i> and
its subdirectories.

<P> Use a terminal window to change to the directory in which you wish the
GENESIS directory tree to reside, and (if the file you downloaded is called
"<i>genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz</i>") give the Unix command:

<PRE>
    gunzip -c genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

For most Linux systems and those with gnu tar, you can simply use:

<PRE>
    tar xvzf genesis-2.4.src.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>
If genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz, is not in this directory, give the full path to
it, e.g. 
<PRE>
    gunzip -c ~joeuser/downloads/genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

<P> Begin by reading the README file in the <i>genesis</i> directory, and
then follow the compilation instructions in <i>genesis/src/README</i>.  If
you are using a package with a precompiled executeable, there will be
installation instructions in a README file within the unpacked
<i>genesis</i> directory.

<P>

<H2>Installing the GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials
</H2>
<P>
It is likely that the GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials have been installed
with this file that you are reading.  If not, download the "Ultimate
GENESIS Tutorial Distribution archive from the GENESIS Web site <A
HREF="http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/UGTD.html">
http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/UGTD.html</A>.  It is available as either
UGTD.tar.gz, or UGTD.zip, which may be extracted with "unzip" or
one of the tools used with Windows for extracting zip files.  In either
case, it extracts to a directory (folder) called "<i>UGTD</i>".  If
you have installed GENESIS, you can extract the files in the
<i>genesis/Tutorials</i> directory, alongside the <i>Scripts</i>, <i>Doc</i>,
<i>Hyperdoc</i>, and other GENESIS directories.  This will allow you to
treat it as an extension of the documentation in the GENESIS distribution.

<P> The GENESIS tutorials refer to this "GENESIS Tutorials directory", which
contains the tutorials themselves, this README file, and other directories
such as the <i>cells</i> directory, which contains cell models that are used
by the tutorials.  The <a href="index.html">index.html</a> file in the GENESIS
Tutorials directory is the master index to the tutorials.  It would be a good
idea to set a bookmark to this file in your web browser, so that you will have
the links to the tutorials and to the GENESIS documentation easily available.

<P> If you have installed GENESIS, the hypertext GENESIS Reference Manual will
be in <i>genesis/Hyperdoc/Manual.html</i>.

<P>

<H2>Running GENESIS simulations</H2>

<P>
You can try out some of the GENESIS demonstration and tutorial
simulations in the <i>genesis/Scripts</i> directory.  This directory and its
subdirectories each have a README file with information about the files
to be found in the directory.   For example, assuming that the GENESIS
directory is <i>/usr/local/genesis</i>, you can run the "Squid" tutorial
on Hodgkin-Huxley channels by giving the commands:

<PRE>
    cd /usr/local/genesis/tutorials/squid
    genesis Squid
</PRE>

<P>
Other demos and tutorials that you might want to try are <i>traub91</i>,
<i>burster</i>, <i>neurokit</i>, <i>purkinje</i>, and <i>piriform</i>.  In
some cases, you will want to copy a set of GENESIS simulation scripts into a
directory of your own, so that you can modify the scripts or run simulations
that create output files.  (The permissions of the GENESIS directories are set
so that you cannot write into them.)  For this you can create your own Scripts
directory with "<tt>mkdir ~/Scripts</tt>" and then copy a directory tree with
a command such as

<PRE>
    cp -r /usr/local/genesis/Scripts/purkinje ~/Scripts
</PRE>
<P>
You can also try out some of the GENESIS cell and network simulations from
the included archives of <A HREF="cells/index.html">cell</A> and
<A HREF="networks/index.html">network</A> simulation
scripts.

<P>


Once you are able to run these scripts, you can begin to modify them or
write your own, using the information in the
<A HREF="index.html">GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials</A>.
