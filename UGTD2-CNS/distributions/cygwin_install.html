<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Installing GENESIS with Cygwin under Windows</A></H1>


<P>
This Mini-Tutorial on installing GENESIS with Cygwin under Windows was
contributed by Avrama Blackwell at George Mason University.

<P>
Both the full GENESIS source distribution (genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz) and the
binary distrubution for use with Cygwin (genesis-2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz)
contain a file "README.bindist".  This has a section on installing GENESIS
under Windows, using Cygwin to provide a UNIX-like environment to run
GENESIS and other UNIX programs that have been compiled to run under
Cygwin.  The source distribution also contains the file "README.cygwin"
with additional information on compiling GENESIS for Cygwin, and some other
notes regarding the use of Cygwin.  The Mini-Tutorial below gives a concise
description of the steps required, and has been updated to reflect changes
in packaging since the original README files were written.


<UL>
  <LI>with Firefox or IE under Windows XP or Vista, go to http://www.cygwin.com

  <LI>click on install or update now to download setup.exe

  <LI>double click on setup.exe when it appears on the desktop, or run it
if given the option by the browser

  <LI>click next

  <LI>click install from internet

  <LI>accept root directory of c:\cygwin or change it

  <LI>install for "all users", default text file type "unix/binary"

  <LI>local package directory: accept default or change it

  <LI>on next screen acept "direct connection"

  <LI>next, choose mirror site, e.g. gatech

  <LI>select additional packages:

  <UL>
    <LI>from editors:
    <UL>
      <LI>emacs
      <LI>emacs-X11

    </UL>
    <LI>from X11:
    <UL>
      <LI>cygwin-x-doc
      <LI>font-adobe-dpi100
      <LI>nedit
      <LI>xinit
      <LI>X-start-menu-icons

    </UL>
  </UL>
  <LI>click next.  If it lists files that are required, but not selected,
  accept them and click next.

  <LI>do something while it installs, then click finish

  <LI>To test, double click on the Cygwin icon on the desktop.  This will bring
up a bare console window for entering Windows and most UNIX bash commands.
From within the Cygwin window, type "startxwin.bat".  This will bring up an
xterm terminal window that is fancier than the the Cygwin console, and can
be used for running GENESIS.

</UL>
<P>
OR

<P>
from the Windows Start menu, click on Cygwin-X, then on xterm.  This will
bring up the xterm window, without the plain Cygwin window.

<H1><A NAME="section-2.">Installing GENESIS</A></H1>

<P>
Open a web browser in Windows and go to http://genesis-sim.org.

<P>
From the "Get GENESIS" link at the left, choose "View all releases" and
then download genesis-2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz.

<P>
Put it into /usr/local (name of unix directory), or c:\cygwin\usr\local (if
working in Windows and c:\cygwin was specified above as the root directory)

<P>
Start cygwin by clicking on the desktop icon.

<P>
Working in the xterm, type:

<PRE>
    cd /usr/local
    tar -xvzf genesis-2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>
To test the installation, open an xterm window (not the Cygwin window) as
described above, and type:

<PRE>
    cd /usr/local/genesis-2.3/genesis
    ./binsetup
    cp .simrc ~
    cd Scripts/Squid
    ../../genesis Squid
</PRE>

<P>
If you see the monitor filled with graphs and multi-color panels, then it is
working!

<P>Please report any problems or experiences using GENESIS 2.3 under Cygwin
to the user forums at http://genesis-sim.org, or to the genesis-sim-users
mailing list.
