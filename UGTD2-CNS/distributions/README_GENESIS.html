<H2>This is the README file for the GENESIS downloads directory</H2>
<P>(Updated May 28, 2009.)
</CENTER>

<P>
This directory contains the March 2006 distribution of GENESIS version 2.3.

<P>
GENESIS 2.3 supercedes version 2.2.1, and has a number of changes in the
simulator source code to allow use on a greater variety of platforms,
including Intel and AMD 64 bit processors, MacIntosh with OS/X, and
Microsoft Windows with the Cygwin environment.  It includes Kinetikit
Version 11, Version 2 of the Purkinje cell tutorial, some new objects and
enhancements of existing ones, plus revised and updated documentation.
<P>
We expect that GENESIS 2.3 will be the last GENESIS 2 release, before we begin
preliminary releases of GENESIS 3.  Therefore we encourage all GENESIS users
to upgrade to this (hopefully) final GENESIS 2 release.

<P> This directory also contains the latest release of Parallel GENESIS
(PGENESIS 2.3.1), which now has support for MPI as well as PVM.  It should
run on almost any multiple core PC, parallel cluster, SMP, supercomputer,
or network of workstations where MPI and/or PVM is supported, and on which
serial GENESIS itself is runnable.  For further information about the use
and installation of PGENESIS, please see <A
HREF="README.pgenesis.html">README.pgenesis</A>, which is a copy of the the
README file in the PGENESIS distribution.  There is also additional
hypertext documentation in the PGENESIS distribution.  Note that older
versions of PGENESIS will not work with GENESIS 2.3 or later.

<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Downloading GENESIS and PGENESIS</A></H1>

<P>
This directory contains several different forms of the GENESIS 2.3
distribution.  

<P>
The GENESIS source distribution contains full source code and documentation
for both GENESIS and XODUS as well as a large number of tutorial and
example simulations.  Documentation for these tutorials is included along
with online GENESIS help files and the hypertext GENESIS Reference Manual.

<P>
It is available in the following compressed archive formats:

<UL>
  <LI>genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz - A gzipped tar archive that unpacks (with gunzip and
  tar) to genesis-2.3/genesis.

  <LI>genesis-2.3-src.tar.bz - A more highly compressed form of the archive, that
  is recommended it you have the bunzip2 utility installed.

  <LI>genesis-2.3-src.tar.Z - A less highly compressed form of the archive, to
  be used if you have only the old UNIX uncompress utility.

  <LI>pgenesis-2.3-src.tar.gz - A gzipped tar archive for PGENESIS.  Note that
  the GENESIS source distribution must also be installed to use PGENESIS.

</UL>

<P>
MD5 checksum files are also provided to check the integrity of the
downloaded files.  For example, after downloading the archive file and the
corresponding file with the ".md5" extension, type
<PRE>
    md5sum -c genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz.md5
</PRE>

<P>
Binary distributions are also available that include precompiled versions
of both genesis (with XODUS, dependent on X11 installation) and nxgenesis
(non-X genesis, without the XODUS GUI, hence no X11 dependence).  These
contain all the contents of the full source distribution, except for the
source code.  They also unpack to form the directories genesis-2.3/genesis.
After unpacking the distribution, please consult the file README.bindist
for installation instructions.

<P>
The genesis executables have been linked with certain versions of dynamic
libraries. These libraries must be available at run time, so the binary
versions are not guaranteed to work on all operating system versions.  If you
have problems running a binary distribution, or want to compile your own
version of GENESIS, please get the source distribution.

<P>
The binary distributions currently available are:

<UL>
  <LI>genesis-2.3-linux-bin.tar.gz - A gzipped tar archive for Linux.
  This should run under most recent Linux distributions.

  <LI>genesis-2.3-cygwin-bin.tar.gz - A gzipped tar archive for Windows, using
  Cygwin.  Cygwin (http://cygwin.com) is a free Windows application that
  provides a UNIX-like environment for Windows. It is easy to install
  directly from the Cygwin site, and provides much of the functionality of
  UNIX or Linux, complete with X-windows support, under Windows. Installing
  Cygwin will let you use Windows to run GENESIS and other UNIX programs
  that have been compiled to run under Cygwin.

  <LI>genesis-2.3-cygwin-bin.zip - The Windows/Cygin binary distribution
  packaged for use with the zip utilty, commonly used with Windows.

  <LI>genesis-2.3-osx-bin.tar.gz - A gzipped tar archive for the Mac with
  OS/X.  This should run under recent versions of OS/X.

</UL>
<P>
<B>NOTE for Windows users:</B>
<P>
If you are using a computer with Windows to install the GENESIS binary for
Windows, you can download genesis-2.3-cygwin-bin.zip, and use Winzip or a
similar utility to extract it.  Then, read the file genesis/README.bindist
for information about installing Cygwin.  If you are planning on installing
the source "tar.gz" distribution, you will need to install Cygwin first, in
order to have a terminal window to enter the "tar" commands above for
extracting the files.  Here is a link to
<A HREF="README.bindist.html">README.bindist</A> with the instructions.
<P>

If you experience any trouble compiling or running GENESIS, be sure to
see the README file in the Bug-fixes directory for any patches or changes
since the release of the 2.3 distribution.   The LATEST.NEWS file
also contains information on recent developments and changes.

<H1><A NAME="section-2.">Installation</A></H1>

<P>
After downloading the distribution that you plan to install, change to the
directory in which you wish the GENESIS directory tree to reside.  For a
system-wide installation, it is common to use /usr/local/.  If this is a
system directory such as /usr/local, you will probably need to have root
privileges to do this.  However, you can install it on one of your own
directories with no special privileges.

<P>
If you have downloaded the file genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz, it should be
uncompressed with the gnu "gunzip" utility, then extracted with tar.  This
can be done with:

<PRE>
    gunzip -c genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

On most Linux systems, and those with GNU tar, it is possible to simply use:

<PRE>
    tar xvzf genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz
</PRE>
<P>
If genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz, is not in this directory, give the full path to
it, e.g.

<PRE>
    gunzip -c ~joeuser/downloads/genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz | tar xvf -.
</PRE>
<P>
Note that genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz <B>cannot</B> be uncompressed with the UNIX
compress utility.  If you do not have gunzip, use the genesis-2.3-src.tar.Z
file instead, with the command "zcat genesis-2.3-src.tar.Z | tar xvf -".

<P>
These commands will create the directory tree 'genesis-2.3/genesis' with a
number of subdirectories.  Begin by reading the README file in the
'genesis' directory.  Directions for compiling and installing the software
may be found in the README file contained in the 'src' subdirectory.  Also,
be sure to carefully read the comments in 'src/Makefile'.  In the case of a
binary distribution, there will be a file 'README.bindist'.

<P>
Directions for using the documentation may be found in 'Doc/README'.  The
'Scripts/README' file describes the demonstration and tutorial simulations
which are included with this distribution.  The 'Tutorials' directory
contains additional hypertext documentation, including a beginners guide to
UNIX/Linux commands.  This directory also serves as a "place holder" for
supplemental hypertext GENESIS modeling tutorials and documentation,
including the GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials package.  The latest
version of this package is offered as a separate download from the GENESIS
web site, http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS. The downloaded file
(Tutorials.tar.gz or Tutorials.zip) should be unpacked in the 'genesis'
directory in order to augment the files that are already provided there.

<P>
The PGENESIS source distribution is unpacked in a similar manner, to
produce the directory tree genesis-2.3/pgenesis.  The 'pgenesis/README'
file gives installation instructions for PGENESIS.  To use PGENESIS, you
will need to have PVM or MPI installed.  If you do not have PVM installed
on your computer, you can get the latest version, as well as more
information about PVM from the PVM home page:
 
<P>
        http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html.
 
<P>
A PVM distribution and manual is also available from the GENESIS site, but
it is not guaranteed to be the most recent version.

<H1><A NAME="section-3.">GENESIS Description</A></H1>

<P>
GENESIS is a general purpose simulation platform which was developed to
support the simulation of neural systems ranging from complex models of
single neurons to simulations of large networks made up of more abstract
neuronal components.  GENESIS has provided the basis for laboratory courses
in neural simulation at Caltech, the Marine Biological Laboratory, the
Bangalore, European Union, and Latin American (LASCON) short courses in
Computational Neuroscience, and at least 49 universities of which we are
aware.  Most current GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of
biological neural systems.  Although the software can also model more
abstract networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation
and similar connectionist modeling.

<H1><A NAME="section-4.">Machine dependence</A></H1>

<P>
GENESIS and its graphical front-end XODUS are written in C and are known to
run under many UNIX-based systems with the X Window System (X11R5 or
X11R6), as well as OSX and Windows with Cygwin. This is a partial list of
tested UNIX/Linux platforms:

<UL>
  <LI>x86-based Linux systems:
  <UL>
    <LI>Debian Linux with kernel 2.x
    <LI>Fedora Core 2, 3, and 4
    <LI>Gentoo
    <LI>Ubuntu
    <LI>Mandrake Linux 7, 8, and 9.1 (but not 9.0)
    <LI>Red Hat Linux 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
    <LI>Slackware 10
  </UL>
  <LI>64 bit Linux:
  <UL>
    <LI>Fedora Core 3 and 4
    <LI>Red Hat Enterprise
  </UL>
  <LI>x86-based FreeBSD 4.1
  <LI>Alpha with Debian 3.0
  <LI>IBM SP2 systems running AIX 4.2 and 4.3
  <LI>PPC-based Linux systems running LinuxPPC, SUSE 7.0, and OSX.
  <LI>SGI MIPS-based systems running IRIX 5.x and 6.5.x
  <LI>Sun SPARC-based systems running Solaris 2.6, and 2.7

</UL>
<P>
It is quite likely that GENESIS will also work on systems running other
versions of the operating systems listed above; however, the GENESIS
developers only have direct experience with the particular systems listed.

<P>
GENESIS may *fail* to work on DEC Alpha-based systems. Please let us know
of any experiences with this platform.

<P>
GENESIS has in the past worked on the following systems, but the developers
do not have these systems available for full testing and have not been able
to adequately verify that GENESIS 2.3 compiles and runs properly:

<UL>
  <LI>Sun SPARC-based systems running SunOS 4.1.x
  <LI>Sun SPARC-based running Solaris 2.5/2.5.1
  <LI>HP-UX systems
  <LI>Intel Paragon
  <LI>DECStation running Ultrix 4.x or 3.x
  <LI>Cray T3E and T3D

</UL>
<P>
We welcome feedback on experiences with these platforms.  If you attempt to
use GENESIS on these systems and have problem reports (or even better,
fixes), please contact the GENESIS maintainers.

<H1><A NAME="section-5.">GENESIS Scripts</A></H1>

<P>
In addition to demonstrations which illustrate GENESIS features and
techniques for programming simulations, the genesis/Scripts direcctory
contains a number of interactive tutorials for teaching concepts in
neurobiology and neural modeling.  As their use requires no knowldge of
GENESIS programming, they are suitable for use in a computer simulation
laboratory which would accompany upper division undergraduate and graduate
neuroscience courses.  Each of these has on-line help and a number of
suggested exercises or "experiments" which may be either assigned as
homework or used for self-study.  These tutorials may also be taken apart
and modified to create your own simulations, as they are reasonably well
commented.  Several of them are derived from existing research simulations.
In addition there are a number of example simulation scripts to illustrate
the use of various GENESIS features.  These simulations are described in
detail in "The Book of GENESIS" by James M. Bower and David Beeman, which
is available for download from the GENESIS web site.

<H1><A NAME="section-6.">The GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials</A></H1>

<P>
The genesis/Tutorials directory in the GENESIS distribution is provided as
a "place holder" for supplemental hypertext GENESIS modeling tutorials and
documentation, including the GENESIS Neural Modeling Tutorials package.
These are an evolving set of HTML tutorials intended to teach the process
of constructing biologically realistic neural models with the GENESIS
simulator.  The latest version of this package is offered as a separate
download from the GENESIS web site.  The Tutorials directory that comes
with the GENESIS distribution contains a short guide to getting around in
the UNIX command line environment that may be helpful to new users who are
unfamiliar with entering commands into a terminal window.

<H1><A NAME="section-7.">GENESIS Users Group (BABEL)</A></H1>

<P>
Due to the large number of requests for GENESIS, we are only able to
provide limited help or support for those who acquire GENESIS through the
GENESIS web site.  Therefore, we strongly encourage serious users of
GENESIS to join the GENESIS Users Group (BABEL) mailing list
"genesis-sim-users" and to subscribe to the user forums on the
GENESIS web site.
