<H2> This is the README.cygwin file from the genesis-2.3-src distribution</H2>
<P>
(Updated May 26, 2009)

<P>
Cygwin provides a UNIX-like environment for Windows that will let you run
GENESIS and other UNIX programs that have been compiled to run under Cygwin.
Go to http://cygwin.com, and look for the "Install Cygwin now" link.  This
will download a small setup.exe, which will let you choose what to install and
then download it.  For more information about selecting packages to install,
use the link for "Help on setup.exe".  For more information on Cygwin, see
the Cygwin users guide at http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/

<P>
<STRONG>RUNNING GENESIS</STRONG><BR>
GENESIS can be run under Windows with the Cygwin software installed. If you want
to run GENESIS with GUI capabilities, the X windows package must be installed
under Cygwin. The instructions below assume you want GUI capabilities. You
should be able to run non-graphical GENESIS (nxgenesis.exe) with a standard
Cygwin installation.

<P>
More information on installing and using X windows with Cygwin can be found in
the Cygwin/X User's Guide at http://x.cygwin.com/docs/ug/cygwin-x-ug.html

<P>
Graphical GENESIS requires the following packages (and all their dependencies):

<PRE>
    Package             Cygwin Category
    -------             ---------------
    coreutils           Base*
    sed                 Base
    X-startup-scripts   X11
    xorg-x11-base       X11
    xterm               X11
</PRE>

<P>
*Recent versions of Cygwin roll textutils and fileutils into coreutils.
If you have an older Cygwin, you may need to install these packages; they are
in the Base category.

<P>
You will probably want to install a text editor for editing GENESIS simulation
scripts or modifying configuration files.  These are found in the Editors
package category.  Text files that are created by UNIX have a different
End-Of-Line terminator than Windows text files.  For that reason, it is best
to use a UNIX editor instead of Windows Notepad for editing GENESIS files.  If
you are more familiar with Windows than UNIX, choose "nedit".  This is an
easy-to-use editor with built-in help that will be familiar to users of
Windows Notepad.  If you are a UNIX user, you may prefer to install emacs or
vi (Vim).


<P>
<STRONG>COMPILING GENESIS</STRONG><BR>
In order to compile GENESIS you will also need the following packages (and
all their dependencies):

<PRE>
    Package             Cygwin Category
    -------             ---------------
    gawk                Base
    grep                Base
    binutils            Development (probably selected with gcc-core)
    bison               Development
    flex                Development
    gcc-core            Development (this is just the C compiler)
    libncurses-devel    Development
    make                Development
    xorg-x11-devel      X11
</PRE>


<P>
1.1) Starting Cygwin with X windows

<P>
GENESIS must be started from an xterm window, not the Cygwin window.

<P>
Once you are done installing Cygwin, you can start Cygwin with X windows by
using Windows Explorer to go to C:\cygwin\usr\X11R6\bin and double click on
startxwin (startxwin.bat).  This will start an X server, plus a terminal
window (xterm) with a UNIX-like bash shell.

<P>
If a terminal window doesn't appear, try bringing up Cygwin without X windows
by double clicking on the desktop Cygwin icon.  Then, start Xwindows by typing
"startxwin.sh" in the Cygwin window.  This will print a lot of diagnostics, but
should start an X server and a terminal window (xterm). If you still don't get
an xterm, examine the diagnostics which were printed to the Cygwin terminal
to determine the cause of the failure. Some versions of Cygwin may not set
the DISPLAY variable. You can check by typing "echo $DISPLAY". If it is not set,
type "export DISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0.0". Then try running "startxwin.sh" again.

<P>
1.2)  Directory (folder) names and paths in Cygwin

<P>
The notation used to refer to directories and paths to files in Cygwin is a
little different than under the usual Windows environment.  The "root"
directory in Windows on the primary drive is C:, the names of directories
(folders) are separated with backslashes, and spaces are allowed in file or
directory names.  UNIX and Cygwin use forward slashes.  If a name contains a
space (not generally done in UNIX), the space must be preceded by a backslash.

<P>
When you start up Cygwin, you are placed in your home directory, in a terminal
window with a bash shell that accepts most familiar UNIX commands.  Your home
directory will be given a name based on the user name that you gave when you
set up Windows.  For example, if the user name is "Louie Louie", with an
inconvenient space in it, you would refer to it in a Cygwin terminal window as
"/home/Louie\ Louie", or the shorthand notation "~".  To Windows, Louie
Louie's Cygwin home directory is "C:\cygwin\home\Louie Louie", assuming that
you installed Cygwin in the default location of C:\cygwin.

<P>
To cygwin, the root Windows directory on drive C: is "/cygdrive/c".
For many commands, you can refer it to it as C:\, but for some
commands, such as the tar archiving command, you have to use the UNIX
notation, as in the command to extract files from a compressed tar archive:

<PRE>
    tar xvzf /cygdrive/c/genesis-2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz
</PRE>

2) If you want to use the precompiled cygwin GENESIS distribution, download
genesis-2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz

<P>
Once you have started Cygwin, pick the place where you want to install the
"genesis" directory tree.  /usr/local is a good choice.  Change to this
directory and extract the genesis directory from the archive file
genesis2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.g.  For example,

<PRE>
        cd /usr/local
        tar xvzf /cygdrive/c/genesis2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz
</PRE>

<P>
or from wherever you have it, (e.g.~/downloads/genesis2.3-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz).

<P>
Then change to the genesis directory (/usr/local/genesis) and follow the
directions given in the README.bindist file.

<P>
3) If you want to compile it yourself, you can use the sources from the
normal GENESIS 2.3 distribution file.  First, unpack the file
genesis-2.3-src.tar.gz, and follow the usual procedure for building genesis,
described in src/README.

<P>
Finally, add the genesis directory to your search path, so that "genesis"
can be found from any directory that you are in.  If your login shell is
bash, you can do this by editing the .bashrc file in your home directory to
add the line

<PRE>
        PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/genesis
</PRE>

at the end of the file.  Alternatively, you can set the PATH
environment in the "System Properties" Control Panel applet.

<P>
(4)Running GENESIS under Cygwin
<P>
You can start the Cygwin X server by running

<PRE>
    <cygwindir>\usr\X11R6\bin\startxwin.bat
</PRE>
<P>
where "&lt;cygwindir&gt;" is the place where you installed Cygwin, e.g.
"C:\cygwin".  This will start an X server, plus a terminal window (xterm)
with a UNIX-like bash shell.  From there you can run genesis as usual.
